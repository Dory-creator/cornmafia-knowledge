Episode 98 - DEcentralized GAming
=================================

In [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) Episode 98 titled "DEcentralized GAming" - Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss various upcoming features in the MMO game "Cornucopias." They reflect on the three-year journey of building the game and the community, and tease upcoming content, including nodes, a new release, community questions, and a special guest. The hosts also share what they are drinking and discuss fly fishing. 

They mention the importance of registering nodes to qualify for rewards and the upcoming release with Avatar updates, leaderboards, and the Land Plot selection tool. 

They also discuss their partnership with [DEGA](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/dega), a decentralized gaming platform, and their plans to expand the project's presence on social media and major exchanges. 

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss the upcoming release of the open world MMO game, Cornucopias. Josh reflects on the three-year journey of building the game and the community, and tease upcoming content, including a discussion on nodes, a new release, community questions, and a special guest from one of their partners.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=300) In this section Josh discusses the excitement of fly fishing using top lures that sit on the water's surface. He shares his enjoyment of the instantaneous excitement when fish attack the lure. The video then transitions to an update on the project, where they have delivered NFTs and created a new section on their website for managing file nodes. Those who have purchased nodes can register them and qualify for rewards during the month of July. The speaker also mentions that nodes can be registered on different chains and wallets, and encourages everyone to register their nodes before the 31st of July.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=600) In this section Rob discusses the current status of file node registrations, which stands at around 45%. He emphasizes the importance of registering to qualify for rewards and encourages listeners to do so as soon as possible. The speaker also mentions an upcoming release with Avatar updates, leaderboards, and a land plot selection tool, as well as ongoing work on expanding the game's capacity to accommodate tens of thousands or even millions of users through Amazon scaling infrastructure.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=900) In this section the topic shifts to community questions. A viewer asks if public transportation will be the only way to travel in the city or if there will be faster methods. The speaker explains that there will be public transport, similar to the World Breaker, but some NFTs, such as the GTi Javelin, Bubblejett Bonanza, and Astro 4, will allow for faster travel between zones. However, for travel within the domes, mounts will be the faster option, which will be discussed in the future. Another question is posed about having COPI Cafe once a month for community questions, to which the speaker suggests considering Twitter spaces or Discord AMAs as alternatives. The team is planning to answer more questions in these formats but needs to discuss it with marketing. The implementation of plans can be challenging due to the agile and fast-paced development of the project.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=1200) In this section Carlos Rene, CEO and Founder of DEGA, discusses his company's mission to empower individuals to design, publish, and monetize games at low cost. He introduces DEGA as a decentralized gaming platform and explains their vision to create tools for game development at the application and infrastructure levels. They aim to create 2D pixel art games that can run on low-cost smartphones. DEGA has been working with Cornucopias for almost two years, with a multi-tiered role including advisor and partnership. DEGA provided technical support for implementing [BASE Chain](/the-company/technology/cross-chain-technology/base-chain) NFTs. The next topic is racing chain data, which DEGA is working on with Cornucopias to publish data publicly for others to use.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=1500) In this section the speakers discuss the readiness of the racing data to move from development to production and the potential benefits of open data access for third parties. The speakers also mention their partnership with an eSports company, Infinity Gaming, which is one of the largest in Latin America, and discuss the potential of engaging the wider audience through this collaboration. The speakers express their excitement about the company's enthusiasm for web3 technology and their plans to announce a strategy for working together next week.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=1800) In this section the speakers discuss upcoming announcements and initiatives for the DEGA project. The community is encouraged to join the DEGA Discord and Telegram channels for future updates.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uud9aFv8CP8&t=2100) In this section Josh and Rob announce the upcoming racing tournament, which will include qualifying races and a weekly leaderboard to determine participants for the final bracket round. The details are subject to change, but the goal is to make it a fun and engaging experience for the community, with potential involvement of influencers and big prizes for the final tournament. The speakers remind viewers that they are in pre-alpha and there maybe issues, but encourage everyone to join in and have fun. They conclude by expressing their gratitude for the community's support throughout the development process.
