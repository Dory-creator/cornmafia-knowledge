### AOB

Planning the booth for cNFTcon is underway, we cannot wait to meet everyone in person. Watch [COPICafe Episode 24](/gameplay/community/copicafe) for information on the planning.

Work on the farming element of the UE5 Metaverse game has really picked up pace with our new junior analyst working alongside the 2 other team members. 

We have begun work on transferring the research we have done over the past 9 months into the draft version of the COPIWiki (non-public). 

So far we ‌have the outline and 10 detailed pages complete. We estimate when the farming section and some other elements are signed off we should have at least 50 new pages to add to the live [COPIWiki](/gameplay/community/copiwiki) - estimated merge is late 2022/early 2023. The update will contain lots of new game lore, gameplay and new exciting, not talked about details.

The [Origin story](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/the-origin-story) of Cornucopias is almost complete and will be ready for internal review in a few weeks. This should be added to the COPIWiki later this year.
