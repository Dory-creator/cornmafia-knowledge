Episode 94 - Live Nodes!
========================

In [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) Episode 94 titled "Live Nodes!", the hosts Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss the advancements in their open world MMO project, Cornucopias. 

They share their experiences at industry events where they showcased the game, met industry professionals, and made potential partnerships. 

The hosts also discuss the development of the delegate system for running nodes, the importance of rarity in the game, and the upcoming nodes calculator. 

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss the open world MMO game, Cornucopias and recap Consensus 2024, an event where they showcased the game, and discuss land and nodes updates, ISPO block production, and answer some community questions. They also express the importance of in-person events like Consensus, where they can connect with their team and see the reactions of new players.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=300) In this section the speaker shares their experience at Consensus 2024 where they showcased the Cornucopias blockchain game. The game attracted a lot of attention, with many people asking what it was and expressing excitement upon learning it was a blockchain game. The biggest question, however, was how the game was blockchain-based. The speaker believes they are in an undiscovered niche, as there were only a few gaming stations at the conference. They predict that in the next year or so, there will be massive conferences dedicated to web 3 gaming. The speaker also expresses their excitement about the opportunity to bring mainstream gamers into crypto using their game. They thank their team members and collaborators for their support at the conference.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=600) In this section the speakers discuss the engagement and impressions they received from industry professionals at a gaming event. They mention meeting one of the founders of Star Citizen and also a game economist, who were both impressed with their project. The team also interacted with influencers like George from CryptosRUs and Jesus Martinez. The event showcased the power of gaming to bring people together and create meaningful connections.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=900) In this section the speaker shares their experience at an event where they came across various booths and interactions. One random encounter that stood out was a DeLorean car. They also discovered a booth with the original developer of Rampage, Kenneth Hurley, and his colleague Eric Knauss. The team was able to make potential partnerships, explore financial products, and find a new HR solution, making the event worthwhile. The speaker expresses their excitement about the mixture of use cases for blockchain and web 3 applications, such as banking and HR solutions, which will change how they handle payments and organizational work in the future.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=1200) In this section the speakers discuss a potential new partnership with Apex Fusion, a cross-chain solution for Cardano. They express excitement about the deal, as Apex utilizes Cardano technology and is working with several Cardano projects as launch partners. The speakers believe this partnership will help Cardano projects during the bear cycle by providing a staking mechanism and generating revenue. They also mention that Apex's compatibility with Cardano will contribute to the adoption of both chains. Additionally, they discuss updates on the World Travel Loop within Cornucopias Game and the progress made on the Land Grab tasks.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=1500) In this section the speaker expresses his awe over the game's stunning water technology. He emphasizes the importance of water in the game, especially for fishing and exploring various landscapes. The speaker also shares his excitement about the progress of the file nodes, which are coming along well and will soon be accessible to the public. He admits that setting up the nodes required some technical knowledge but assures viewers that they will provide commercial-quality technology and improve the setup process over time.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=1800) In this section Rob discusses the development of the delegate system for running nodes, which caters to both the technically proficient and less experienced individuals. They have created working Linux and Windows versions of the nodes, which will be available via Docker. This is just the beginning of the potential offerings of this distributed infrastructure. The current node holders will have the first opportunity to purchase future nodes. The node ownership also comes with an NFT, and the sales have been going quickly, with only about 25 days left before they end. To participate, individuals need to register their node NFT on the new platform, which will be shared in a few weeks, and they will start receiving full rewards from day one. The rollout of nodes will occur in three phases: phase one begins on July 1, 2024, with rewards distributed to registered nodes; phase two invites individuals to download and run the nodes; and phase three, the performance of the pool will determine the rewards.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=2100) In this section the team discusses the timeline for the release of nodes and the number of delegates permitted per node. They explain that the integration into the launcher and reward systems are still under development, and the nodes are currently working. The team aims to have the nodes up and running in full force by early next year but will not rush the process. They also reveal a leak about the number of delegates, which has been doubled from two to four per node. This means that if someone owns eight nodes, they can have up to 32 delegates if they run a public node pool. The rewards will come from two reward pots: one from Cornucopias and the other from the delegates subscription service. The team is also working on a dashboard on the website where node holders can claim their rewards.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=2400) In this section the creators explain that they are partnering with [DripDropz](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/dripdropz) to facilitate the claiming process and are on track to meet their promises. The creators also share that they have used ChatGPT to create a proof of concept for a nodes calculator, which will be available soon as a webpage with various caveats. They encourage viewers to buy nodes on their website and participate in supporting the infrastructure. The creators also mention that land plot Rarity may impact the resources available on the land at the start of the season and discuss a potential question about the relevance of land Rarity after the land grab.
* [**00:45:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=2700) In this section the creators discuss the role of rarity in their upcoming game, which they aim to make "play to win" rather than "pay to win." Rarity influences the order in which players can choose land plots during events, with Mythics getting first pick, followed by Legendaries, Rares, Uncommons, and Commons. The creators also plan to differentiate the aesthetics of buildings based on rarity to provide visual variety. Additionally, XP boosts will depend on land rarity, with lower-level lands providing more land owner XP. Maintenance requirements for properties will also vary based on rarity, with more rare land plots requiring less maintenance. The creators plan to explain these mechanics in more detail in the future. Overall, rarity adds gamification elements, such as visual variety and the need to care for properties, while aiming to maintain fairness for free players.
* [**00:50:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w-SxyBOg1f0&t=3000) In this section the video concludes with the host expressing hope that viewers enjoyed the content and announcing that they will see everyone in the next week's episode of [COPI Cafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe). The host then plays some music and the video ends.
