* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=0) In this section hosts Rob Greig and Josh Jones discuss Cornucopias. The hosts share community images and discuss running around in Solace 2.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=300) In this section the creators discuss their journey, checking their map to determine their next destination, Timber Creek. They reflect on the differences between the areas they've visited and express excitement about the potential for development and evolution in the town. The team also shares their appreciation for the accuracy of the in-game maps provided by various guilds, noting the intrigue of seeing how these groups have used the data to create their own versions.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=600) In this section the creators discuss the logging area in the game and the concept of resource gathering. They explain that players can only chop down trees in designated logging areas to prevent reckless tree cutting. The speaker shares their experience playing the game on a laptop with medium graphics settings and expresses excitement about the potential graphics improvement on a more powerful setup. They also speculate about the process of transporting chopped logs from the logging area.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=900) In this section the speaker highlights various creative contributions from the game's community. The Corn Mafia Guild is showcased for creating a spinning wheel that indicates day and night cycles on both European and North American servers. The image also includes information about specific builds and land plots. Another interactive map from the Knights Guild is presented, which highlights different districts and includes fishing areas and monorail routes. Both guilds have invested significant time and effort into their creations, adding value to the game and inspiring the developers.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=1200) In this section the creators discuss adjustments to the game's land plots and resources. They explain that some areas will be moved apart to avoid overlap, and additional resources will be added. The creators also mention that they are developing their own maps and will make the data for land plot locations publicly available for community members to use. They express excitement about the community's involvement in creating maps and adding to the game. The creators also showcase some creative contributions from the community, including AI-generated designs for a robot dog, robot eagle, and a cool dude with a jetpack.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=1500) In this section the speaker introduces a special guest, Scruffy, to discuss the "purple track." The purple track is described as being between the red and yellow tracks in terms of difficulty, with more subtle turns and unique features, including driving through the clouds and inverted perspective. The speaker mentions that the track is longer than the yellow track and offers a unique driving experience that requires strategic thinking rather than just holding down the thrusters. The purple track is expected to be released shortly after the upcoming NFT sale, allowing racers to test new vehicles on the new track. Additionally, there are plans to make some adjustments to the yellow track to address issues with certain vehicles getting "stuck" on the big loop.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=1800) In this section the speakers discuss various updates and improvements to the game. Scruffy shares that there have been significant changes to the yellow track, which may result in faster lap times due to reduced G force. The team is also working on Esperanza, and making progress on it. Additionally, they are testing updated file nodes that could potentially save them a significant amount of money on server costs. The team is also addressing issues with land plots and ensuring they are relatively clear and level for future building. Overall, good progress is being made in various areas of the project.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=2100) In this section the creators discuss the current state and future plans for Solace. They express their excitement about the game's unique features and the upcoming additions that will enhance the gameplay experience. Regarding the question of shared resources between servers, they explain that there is a shared database, but some elements may not be instantly reflected across servers. Mining areas will have specific minerals, and there will be variations between different zones.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JXWw-ifMCRU&t=2400) In this section the hosts discuss this weeks leak.
