Episode 96 - Quantum Leak!
==========================

In [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) Episode 96 titled "Quantum Leak!", the hosts Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss the advancements in their open world MMO project, Cornucopias. 

They talk about upcoming events, such as having a booth at Rare Evo in August 2024 and the possible attendance of Digital Asset News and influencer the Crypto Crow. 

The team also delves into the intricacies of preparing and selecting land plots for the Themed Zone [Solace](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-1-solace), the upcoming crafting system, and the release of nodes and avatar creator bill. 

A special guest, Jillian, joins the conversation to discuss her work on creature creation, including various animals with distinct characteristics and potential interactions. The team also shares their progress on creating quantum animals, which could be friendly or hostile, and expresses excitement about the possibilities of these creatures in the game.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss the progress of their open world MMO project, Cornucopias. They introduce the game's unique setting, a world of floating islands with advanced dome structures in the sky, each containing distinct environments and communities. Players can explore these islands, engage in various activities, and choose their own destiny. The hosts also mention upcoming events, including a booth at Rare Evo from August 15th to 17th 2024, and the attendance of Digital Asset News and Crypto Crow, who have previously communicated with the team online.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=300) In this section the speaker discusses potential competitions and events for the Corn community. They mention the possibility of hosting influencer battles between different influencers and the consolidation of cNFTCon and Rare Evo into one main event. The speaker also talks about earning [COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) through staking Ada in the COPI ISPO and the process of laying out land plots for the upcoming game. They mention the challenge of manually placing and saving 8,000 land plots and the upcoming task of having three people place them down ready for review by David.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=600) In this section the speakers continue to discuss the intricacies of preparing and selecting land plots for the game Solace. The process involves not only laying down the plots but also reviewing and QA checking them. Additionally, players will need to use an upcoming update to the website to select their preferred plots. The speakers emphasize that this is just the beginning of the tasks required for the land grab, which also includes getting [Solace](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-1-solace) ready for an event in August and potentially also completing the [Esperanza](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-2-esperanza) land grab this year. The team is working on various aspects of the game, including the crafting system and introducing gameplay, with the goal of having a marketable product for mainstream gamers by the first quarter of 2025.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=900) In this section the team discusses the upcoming developments in their game, including the crafting system, which is expected to take at least three months to complete. They also mention the impending launch of nodes, which will help with user onboarding and decentralization of infrastructure. The team is planning to release the second avatar creator update around the same time, which includes new features like beards and maybe glasses and hats. Additionally, they are working on infrastructure improvements and leaderboards for competitions. The "Consensus build", which includes track updates and Avatar improvements, is planned for the start of Q3, with the next build following shortly after.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=1200) In this section the speaker discusses the upcoming release, which has taken longer than anticipated due to under-the-hood updates and the need to pause for Consensus build-out. Exciting foundational work is nearing completion, such as Geoff's infrastructure work for server scaling, which now allows for automated builds, saving time and increasing efficiency. Additionally, auto and manual scaling has been implemented and will be tested in the next build. Q4 will bring land rewards, and the team is about to release a land rewards deck. Despite some minor delays, the majority of the plans outlined in the original white paper are going as planned, with approximately 85% of the content being executed as intended. The speaker reminds viewers to get a node if they haven't already and encourages using the rewards calculator on the Cornucopias website. Node rewards begin accumulating on July 1st 2024.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=1500) In this section the speakers discuss the progress of their project and welcome a special guest, Jillian, who has been working on creature creation in Unreal Engine 5 for about a month. Jillian shares her background in creature art and gaming, and mentions her focus on animals in Solace, which will feature a variety of creatures from Colorado Wyoming, Pacific Northwest, and desert regions. Animals in Solace will include deer, bears, foxes, wolves, elk, moose, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, and possibly spiders. Jillian also mentions that animals will have males and females, and there may be babies as well. The team is working hard to get all the animations and programming done for the animals to move around in the game.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=1800) In this section the creator discusses the behavior and potential interactions with various animals in the game, including deer, bears, and coyotes. She explains that male and female animals will have distinct characteristics, such as antlers for males and spots for babies. The animals will act realistically, with bears ignoring humans unless provoked and deer running away. Players may be able to interact with the animals, possibly attacking or eating them. The creator also shows the process of creating a coyote model in the game, discussing the attention to detail in the muscular structure and the addition of fur. He shares stories of encounters with real animals and speculates about potential interactions in the game.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=2100) In this section the creator discusses the efficiency of creating various animal models using a pre-existing structure. Once the structure is in place, creating a male, female, or baby animal becomes easier, and similar animals with similar body structures can be branched off from. The creator then shows images of textured animals, including a deer, and suggests potential uses such as mounts or food sources. They also discuss the possibility of creating Quantum Monsters, which are animals from different realities that come through riffs and can be either friendly or hostile.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AeLBTAl89Lk&t=2400) In this section the creators discuss quantum animals. They mention a roar heard in a mining video, which could be from a creature from another dimension that steals loot and can travel through dimensions. The team is brainstorming various animals that could have quantum versions, such as a zombified duck or a glowing quantum bear. The animals may have aggressive behaviors and could be helpful or harmful. The team is still in the process of creating these concepts, and some may have permanent glowing elements. They express excitement about the progress they've made and look forward to creating more quantum animals in the future.
