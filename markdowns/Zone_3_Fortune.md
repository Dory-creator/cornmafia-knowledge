Zone 3 - Fortune
================

'Eastern Zone' was the early working title for this zone.

### Overview

Remindful of the Eastern National Parks. The landscape encompasses daunting volcanoes and limestone mountain passes. Temperate lowland rain forests to highland cloud forests, all connected through nature trails that wind through caves, lakes and waterfalls of sheer beauty.

**All 3x Fortune Sectors will be playable when the Fortune Themed Zone is released**

Themed Zones are divided into 3x Sectors, each approximately 8km x 8km. Each Sector is further divided into 4x [Districts](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts) containing player-owned and non-player owned land such as; residential houses, workshops and merchants.

To travel to the Themed Zones from the Sector Hubs, or to travel between each Dome, players can use a [Flying Vehicle](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/flying-vehicles) or [Public Transport.](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/public-transport)

### Once Inside

Each of the Sector Domes within the same Themed Zone are similar in geography but have different map layouts. Features include:

* Active volcanos are a huge tourist attraction.
* Busy districts full of real life players enjoying the lively, friendly community.
* Lots of [Non-Player-Characters](/gameplay/non-player-characters) (NPCs) to visit and offer daily quests.
* Town halls and notice boards offer even more quests.
* Player-owned and free roaming themed farm/wild animals.
* All sizes of player-owned and upgradeable houses are curated to fit the theme of the zone, with some even available to rent at the choice of the owner.
* Player-owned farms and merchant shops ready to trade and craft items.
* Abundant water areas with a huge selection of common and very rare tradeable fish.
* Extremely hot volcanic mines, housing all kinds of precious ore, metals and fossils.
* Tall mountains and hills - some covered in snow all year round.
* Ornamental bridges, roads, walkways, stairways and paths.
* Large recreational areas for daily exercise and gatherings
* Public transport is found in the form of COPI cable cars, providing the most efficient way to navigate the tall mountains.
* Lots of hard to reach places of interest to discover.

### **Travel**

The purest way to travel on land is by foot. Running from end to end in each Sector may take over 30 minutes.

To speed up travels, there are many player-owned mounts that are available to use or rent. Mounts will vary with performance specifications including; speed, acceleration, handling and load capacity. 

There is an underground transport system that will allow players to travel quickly from town to town.
