Zone 2 - Esperanza
==================

'Wild West' was the early working title for this zone.

### Overview

Think back to the Wild West of America. The landscape encompasses a diverse biome, from hot and dry desert plains, rugged mesas, and sagebrush to immense valleys with great forests and cascading rivers.

**All 3x Esperanza Sectors will be playable when the Esperanza Themed Zone is released**

Themed Zones are divided into 3x Sectors, each approximately 8km x 8km. Each Sector is further divided into 4x [Districts](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts) containing player-owned and non-player owned land such as; residential houses, workshops and merchants.

To travel to the Themed Zones from the Sector Hub, or to travel between each Dome, players can use a [Flying Vehicle](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/flying-vehicles) or [Public Transport.](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/public-transport)

### Once Inside

Each of the Sector Domes within the same Themed Zone are similar in geography but have different map layouts. Features include:

* Busy districts full of real life players enjoying the lively, friendly community.
* [Non-Player-Characters](/gameplay/non-player-characters) (NPCs) to visit and offer daily quests.
* [Town halls](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts/district-town-hall) and notice boards that offer quests.
* Player-owned and free roaming farm/wild animals.
* All sizes of player-owned and upgradeable houses are curated to fit the theme of the zone, with some even available to rent at the choice of the owner.
* Player-owned farms, ranches and merchants ready to trade and craft items.
* Water areas full of delicious tradeable fish.
* Desert plains to race mounts with friends.
* Dense forests providing different raw logging materials from trees.
* Deep mines, housing all kinds of precious ore and metals.
* Bridges, roads, walkways and paths.
* Public transport such as trains and boats.
* Campsites for simple overnight rests.
* Places of Interest to discover.

### **Travel**

The purest way to travel on land is by foot. Running from end to end in each Sector may take over 30 minutes.

There is an underground transport system that will allow players to travel quickly from town to town.
