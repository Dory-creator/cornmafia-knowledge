Charles Hoskinson CEO of IOHK, mentioned us on a number of his public appearances, which really helps to spread awareness for Cornucopias.

### AOB

* We have supported more and more small YouTube channels and shared their content on our Discord - this continues to grow our community support.
* We launched the online shop for our Merchandise - <https://shop.cornucopias.io/>
* 100s of inactive OG members had the OG Role removed from them within Discord. The members downgraded, had not interacted with a single message ever, nor had they bought any NFTs or visited the Discord channel in the last 90 days. The OG role is hard to acquire and should also have reasonable requirements to keep as it does come with some amazing perks.
