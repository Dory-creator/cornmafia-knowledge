* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=0) In this section, the hosts showcase gameplay with a jetpack challenge, highlighting the Vanguard outfit that includes a materials pack allowing for customization. They attempt the challenge of landing on floating platforms with jetpacks, showcasing the difficulty and technique required to succeed.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=300) In this section, the players are attempting to navigate through a series of mountaintop checkpoints in a flight simulation game. They aim to reach each spot without touching the ground, presenting a challenging task that requires precise throttle management and landing skills. Despite some overshooting and missed attempts, they eventually succeed in reaching the final checkpoint, showcasing their determination and teamwork to accomplish the goal.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=600) In this section, the creators of the video discuss their recent build release, which included new jetpacks, outfits, a Nexus inventory system, and updates to the Avatar system. They also touched on the re-engineering of certain parts of the game and the addition of seasonal elements like the glimpse of fear. Despite facing some challenges and needing more time to resolve issues, they expressed excitement about the growth and efficiency of their team in creating more content with each new build.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=900) In this section, the team discusses the challenges they faced with debugging and fixing bugs in their game development process, leading to build 9676 with thousands of code pushes since upgrading to UE 5.3. They aim to release one more build before the end of the year, focusing on adding gameplay elements and challenges to the game. The addition of jetpacks in the game is expected to impact players' decisions on land placement, encouraging new strategies and creative gameplay. Additionally, they mention ongoing sales of in-game assets and the upcoming phase two of the sale, highlighting the immediate utility of NFT assets in the game.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=1200) In this section, the hosts introduce various items for sale on the marketplace, including a ZeroG Stratus jetpack, Outlander backpacks, Luna di Lusso Salene backpack, and the highly anticipated Bubblejett Super Phantom ship. They mention the quantities and prices of each item, with some being available in $COPI on Cardano or $COPI on Base. The hosts express excitement about the upcoming releases and hint at phase three developments. Later on, they discuss a community question about players flying while standing on top of each other, revealing that collision mechanics prevent this from happening. Another question addresses the rationale behind setting marketplace prices in $COPI alone, with the hosts explaining their gradual transition towards using $COPI exclusively aligning with their token utility plans.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d3FvZfrUTbY&t=1500) In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges and complexities they face with selling multiple assets on various chains, emphasizing the need to improve efficiency and user experience in their marketplace. They express their intention to gradually increase $COPI utility over time and potentially have all assets sold in $COPI by next year. The team is focused on marketing the base assets and learning from their experiences with Ada and base sales. Additionally, there is mention of a new vehicle, the Bubblejett Super Phantom, as an S-Class vehicle that will compete with the [F9R](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/valkyrie/valkyrie-f9-r). The episode concludes with a message of excitement and optimism for the future of the project in the crypto space.
