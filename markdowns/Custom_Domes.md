Custom Domes
============

Player owned Domes that can be customized

Custom Domes are the largest form of [NFT](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-custom-domes) Land in Cornucopias, and serve as venues for games and events. Using an advanced building system they can be molded in virtually anything. 

**Custom Domes will not be playable when the first version of the game is released.**

Holders can construct freely within their Dome using our innovative and user-friendly Cornucopias Building System. This gives players the power to shape terrain, design and build structures, and showcase creativity - construction potential is truly limitless.

As well as being standalone, the Custom Domes can be used to extend commercial buildings and experiences in the [City](/gameplay/city-life). Moreover, Custom Domes can be linked to [Cardano World](/blockchain/cardano-world).‚Äã

Players will have access to both Themed Building Kits and Gameplay Kits. Themed Kits will help guide a desired experience (PVP, Concert Venue, Art Gallery), and Building Kits will give access to architectural and environmental assets to help create a setting. 

Custom Domes can be used by a single player or multiple, include options to [size your event](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/custom-domes/custom-dome-size-your-event) and sell tickets and merchandise.
