Minting Issues
--------------

After nearly 3 hours of backend problems, the mint for the GTi Javelin was halted, only 5x GTi Javelins were actually minted. They were immediately listed by their new owners on [jpg.store](https://www.jpg.store/collection/cornucopiasgtijavelin2022) marketplace showing the buyers were crypto speculators, not supporters of the project that wanted to keep hold of the NFT assets. However, the *Famous 5* will always be remembered, they are:

* Javelin CM22 #00141 - Common Status
* Javelin RA22 #00190 - Rare Status
* Javelin CM22 #00126 - Common Status
* Javelin CM22 #00144 - Common Status
* Javelin CM22 #00121 - Common Status

----------------------------------------------

After nearly 3 hours we decided to cancel the mint and give away the GTi Javelin Assets for free to everyone that was in the mint queue. We also refunded the Famous 5 so be fair to them as well. 

Here are some articles and social media updates we have released.

*"The community is the heart and soul of a blockchain project. If you have ever spent any time in our Discord, you will see we have a thriving, happy, helpful set of supporters.*

*But it's not good enough to just "care" about your community; you also have to "take care" of your community.*

*We recognize our supporters are global, and during mint times, some people take time off work or get up early or stay glued to screens.*

*If you truly want to understand your supporters, you must also recognize the sacrifices people go through to follow you.*

*This is why it was a difficult call to stop our mint after a few hours. It was an easy decision to give away the precious NFTs we had painstakingly created for our game as compensation for our unforeseen technical difficulties.*

*Strong decisions form strong communities, and we put our community's well-being ahead of sales."*
