Sectors
=======

A Sector is a vast island, levitating amidst the clouds, and encased in an advanced protective shield known as a Dome. There are copious Sectors across Cornucopias and each is carved from a different part of Earth. Each has unique landscape features, characteristics, and backstory.

It is within Sectors that life thrives in Cornucopias and players live, work, socialize, and adventure. The landscape features a host of [raw materials](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/resources) that can be harvested and [crafted](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/user-interface/crafting) into valuable items. Players will come across [quests](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/quest-and-challenges) to venture upon, characters to interact with, and mysteries to unravel.

Players can find [NFT Land Plots](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts/district-land-plots) within Sectors. These plots come in five sizes, each size incrementally increasing the value and utility. Collections of NFT Land Plots are player-owned communities and are known as [Districts](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts). It is within the District players can find shops to engage in commerce, workshops to craft items from materials, and various types of buildings to rest or socialize.

Each Themed Zone offers player rewards for farming, mining, foraging and fishing.

### Hanger Bay

You enter the Sector by approaching via a flying vehicle (Private or Public) and flying into one of the Hanger Bays as can be seen in this old UE4 preview footage ..

The Hanger Bays take you to the huge Central Terminal where you will be greeted by NPCs, shops and all kinds of interactive objects.

From here, you will enter one of the COPI Subway trams that will take you to one of the Surface Stations. Finally, you will enter the Surface Tube and emerge in your chosen Sector District - quite the trip!
