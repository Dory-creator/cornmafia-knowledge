* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=0) In this section, the hosts introduce their discussion by blending reflections on the Thanksgiving holiday with insights into their exciting open-world MMO game, Cornucopias. The conversation shifts to a more personal note as the hosts express their gratitude for the holiday, emphasizing the importance of recognizing positivity and appreciating their collaborative work environment. Wearing Thanksgiving-themed hats, they share light-hearted banter, discuss their upcoming holiday plans, and transition into various topics related to gaming and market updates.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=300) In this section, the speakers discuss the success of their recent [Juggernaut](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/atmos/atmos-juggernaut-2024) sale, noting a quick sell-out on the Cardano platform, where their primary community is based, and mentioning the need for broader outreach on the Base platform. They highlight the effort that went into creating promotional materials for the sale, including an engaging video that showcased new assets and features, such as the upcoming hanger and NPC crowds. Additionally, the hosts encourage viewers to explore the updated COPI Wiki for detailed information about [NFTs](/blockchain/player-owned-assets) and the game, crediting the art team for their contributions to the new assets. The conversation also teases an upcoming discussion about buybacks related to the sale, indicating further insights will be provided.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=600) In this section, the discussion focuses on the current state of liquidity and the buyback mechanism for the [COPI token](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi). A total of $77,000 is allocated for buybacks, with $38,500 already spent on acquiring COPI tokens, which is intended to maintain a circular economy within their ecosystem. The speakers note that while the buyback was initially set at 20% for this sale phase, it will decrease to 10% in the future, as outlined in their [tokenomics paper.](/gameplay/about-the-game/usdcopi-tokenomics) They then transition to discussing the evolution of their Marketplace, highlighting past challenges during its initial launch due to high demand and technology issues. They emphasize the need for a new Marketplace structure to accommodate the integration of game assets and character customization, as well as the necessity for an efficient shopping cart system due to the increased complexity of their offerings. Overall, they convey a sense of progress but note that additional work is still required to fully realize their vision.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=900) In this section, the speaker discusses ongoing improvements to the in-game marketplace and the integration of COPI as a utility for assets. They emphasize the importance of collaborating with an economist to ensure best practices for the economic system. The team is under pressure to create a user-friendly experience, especially for mainstream gamers who may be unfamiliar with crypto wallets. The speaker reveals plans to facilitate wallet creation with simpler authentication methods, while also discussing general market sentiments, particularly a potentially more favorable environment for crypto innovation in the U.S. due to recent political developments. Optimism surrounds upcoming changes that could enhance clarity and support for the crypto market amid ongoing regulatory ambiguity.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around the recent resignation at the SEC and its potential positive impact on the cryptocurrency market, which may signal a shift towards more clearer regulatory conditions. The speakers note encouraging trends in Bitcoin pricing, influenced by factors like global liquidity and a new leadership style that includes business figures rather than traditional politicians. They discuss indicators such as Bitcoin dominance, which shows how Bitcoin's strength in the market is changing and anticipates a possible "alt season," where investments may shift from Bitcoin to alternative coins. The conversation concludes with a light-hearted comparison of this financial dynamic to a fountain, emphasizing the flow of investments between Bitcoin and altcoins, setting a tone of optimism for the upcoming holidays and the year ahead.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=1500) In this section, the speaker addresses questions from the audience regarding the Juggernaut ship and the use of in-game NFT items. They clarify that 1,000 SCU equals 1 FCU, with the Juggernaut capable of carrying 16 large containers of that size. They confirm that the ship can accommodate up to eight players but can be operated solo, although customization options and certain functionalities are limited. The focus remains on the vehicle's practical utility for resource transportation rather than extensive personalization. On the topic of NFTs, the speaker explains that while players own these items, they cannot be dropped for others to pick up, ensuring ownership remains with the player. Future updates may allow temporary access to NFTs for friends without transferring ownership, but the specifics and timeline for these features were not detailed.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BM3sAvi8G9k&t=1800) In this section, the hosts discuss the mechanics of asset rentals within the game, explaining that while players can rent items, they cannot recall them until the rental agreement is complete. They then transition to showcasing a new design for a wood shop, emphasizing its practicality and potential usage within players' lands. The hosts express excitement over the details and functionality of the wood shop, anticipating its role in crafting and resource management in the game. They conclude the conversation with a warm Thanksgiving message, reflecting on gratitude for their community and personal connections.
