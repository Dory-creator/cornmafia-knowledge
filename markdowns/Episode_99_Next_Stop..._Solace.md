=================================

In [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) Episode 99 titled "Next Stop... Solace" - Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss various upcoming features in the MMO game "Cornucopias." 

They are nearing the final stages of setting up the File Node claiming process and urge viewers to register their nodes by the deadline of July 31st 2024 to be eligible for rewards. 

The upcoming release of Solace, is preparing for the land grab event, where players can claim virtual land plots both in-game from the main Cornucopias webpage. 

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss the upcoming rewards for File Nodes. The team is nearing the final stages of setting up the node claiming process, with only the marketing and team nodes left to mint. They estimate that there will be approximately 9,000 nodes in total. The hosts remind viewers that they must register and set up their nodes to be eligible for rewards, as there will be no retroactive claims. Other topics include the recent release of leaderboards and a discussion about the progress in the game's development.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=300) In this section the speaker urges viewers to register their nodes for the Cornucopias project by the deadline of July 31st 2024, UTC midnight. Those who have not registered yet are encouraged to do so through the website's "manage nodes" section and link their wallets. The speaker emphasizes the importance of registering to receive rewards, as there will be no exceptions made after the deadline. The speaker also mentions that the latest registration should be done a few days before the deadline to ensure assistance if needed. The speaker then discusses the COPIC Stake pool, where stakers can receive a 25% bonus in $COPI tokens.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=600) In this section the creators discuss issues they encountered during the game's testing phase. The team was able to address the issue by grouping the top performers and working on a hot fix. The inventory system, the only remaining client-side feature, will be moved to the server in the next build. The creators also mention that performance optimizations were made to the racing feature by David and Kai.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=900) In this section the speakers discuss the recent optimization of the game, specifically in regards to racing with multiple players.

They encourage viewers to share their opinions on the proposed racing change in the comment section. The speakers express excitement for the upcoming release of Solace in the next build.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=1200) In this section the developers discuss the progress of their game, which started two years ago in Unreal Engine 5. They talked about a demo they saw that left them excited for the final version, particularly the travel system. The player begins in [Calido](/gameplay/mega-dome-calido-valley) Valley, enters public transport, and flies across to the [Cloud Gate](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/cloud-gates) before landing in a new sector hub, where they can choose which Solace to visit. Each Solace has 12 lifts corresponding to its towns, and players can travel between them without loading screens. The entirety of Solace is free-roam.

They confirm that the world will be available for exploration at RareEvo, which is scheduled for August 15-17, 2022. The release of Solace is significant because it lays the foundation for faster world travel systems and a larger area to explore, creating variety for players.

The webpage is not yet available, but the team is working on it. The team is currently focused on adding new content, crafting, and fishing to the game, and they are now able to run competitions for NFTs and outfits. They are also in talks with large Esports leagues for tournaments and other events.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4gAxnmZz0BM&t=2100) In this section the hosts discuss a new challenge for viewers: finding all 36 hidden town names in a paper quiz. The hosts encourage viewers to find all 36 names and share their answers, with the promise of revealing the lot once all names are guessed.
