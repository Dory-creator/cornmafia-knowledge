August 2022
===========

**Summary**
-----------


> **August was a huge DELIVERY month for us.​**

We started delivering on the 4th August by announcing the new [COPI StakePool](/blockchain/copi-stake-pool). Within the first weeks it had over 2,000 delegates and over 26m ADA (₳) delegated to it. By the end of the month the figure rose to 3,800 delegates and 48m ₳ - what an incredible launch to a StakePool.

The COPI StakePool which adds to the decentralization of Cardano, immediately responded to its delegates by producing 3 blocks in each of its first 2 epochs and over 30 in its 4th epoch!!

We thank you all for your ongoing support!

That was shortly followed by the usual [NFT2Tree](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-nft2tree-series) "platform test" mint showing off the updates to our [NFT Minting Platform](https://nft.cornucopias.io). 

The [NFT2Tree Series 3](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-nft2tree-series/nft2tree-series-3) mint was a change from the previous "Fastest Finger First" mints and employed a short registration followed by a raffle.​

The NFT2Tree sale geared up for the Custom Dome Sale later that month.

The month ended with our [Custom Dome](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/custom-domes) NFT Sale, which showed another huge leap in our Cardano minting technology and sold out again in seconds.

The introduction of the **COPI Fair Play Algorithm (CFPA)** to our minting technology, prevented a lot of unwanted "bots" from minting multiple NFTs. It's early days for CFPA and we gained even more insights after the sale. The algorithm will evolve and get better and better.

Working with our partner [DripDropz](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/dripdropz), we **launched** [NFT Land Staking](/gameplay/about-the-game/stake-and-earn/nft-staking) which was really well received by the Cornucopias Community.

Other activities:

* We completed the 2nd round of testing for the mobile pre-alpha game with a limited number of Cornucopias Community Apple iPhone testers.
