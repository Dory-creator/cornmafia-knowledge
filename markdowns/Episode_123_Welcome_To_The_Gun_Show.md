They introduce Avatar 3.0, featuring significant visual advancements, and discuss the popularity of recent sales of in-game items while hinting at exciting future features like weapon customization and cross-chain functionality. 

The importance of managing in-game currency and the potential for resets to maintain a balanced competitive environment is emphasized, along with the introduction of unique weapons built with realistic sound design.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=0) In this section, Rob and Josh discuss various topics, including updates on the development of the nodes and their dashboard, which is nearing completion and will soon be made live. They highlight the functionality of the dashboard, including features that allow users to view public and private node pools, track performance statistics like throughput and regional service areas, and assess the health of pools using a traffic light system for easy visibility. The intent is to create a feedback loop for users to enhance their node performance, ultimately ensuring a better experience for newcomers to the Cornucopias game. The hosts also share a light-hearted exchange about their personal drinks and recent activities, maintaining a casual and engaging atmosphere throughout the discussion.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=300) In this section, the team discusses improvements to the onboarding experience, emphasizing a new dashboard that aims to enhance user interaction. They introduce Avatar 3.0, the latest iteration of their avatar system, boasting significant visual enhancements over its predecessors, with more lifelike representations achieved through meticulous refinement and iteration. The discussion highlights the complexity of the development process and the focus on creating more natural-looking avatars by redesigning the underlying system, including muscle structures. They also touch on a current sale for various Vanguard outfits, noting the popularity of the phase one offerings, and mention sold-out items while considering extending the sale deadline to accommodate late purchasers.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=600) In this section, the hosts discuss the upcoming features and sales in their crypto game, emphasizing the importance of cross-chain functionality to enhance user experience across different blockchain networks. They highlight the OG members who received exclusive in-game items, such as the GTI Rampage and a free pistol, which serves as both a gameplay asset and a gateway for new players to learn about wallet use and minting. The conversation then shifts to an exciting announcement about phase two of the sale, which will include various new weapons and items, such as a shotgun and submachine gun, and the introduction of creative cinematics showcasing these items. The hosts encourage viewers to stay tuned until the end of the episode for a preview of these cinematics, while emphasizing the lighthearted and fun nature of the game.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=900) In this section, the hosts celebrate the three-year anniversary of COPICafe, discussing plans for more regular appearances from a guest while sharing what they are drinking—water from a Stanley bottle for hydration. They then segue into a conversation about game mechanics related to player animations and interactions with weapons. The guest addresses community questions about player deaths, noting that players will have a Ragdoll effect upon dying and may lose part of their inventory, emphasizing that death will have consequences in gameplay. They also touch on the dynamic nature of NFTs in the game, indicating that game items can evolve, both visually and statistically, to maintain balance. Additionally, they mention the potential for in-game currency (IGC) wipes in future builds to prevent exploitation, with the next release aiming for a reset to ensure a fair competitive environment.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around managing in-game currency (IGC) and potential exploits within the game. The speakers express a commitment to ensuring the stability of IGC while considering various solutions, such as seasonal currencies and the importance of in-game assets, particularly in light of potential exploits that could necessitate wiping assets, which they prefer to avoid. They highlight the security of NFTs, which protect players' ownership of their items even if in-game possessions are lost. As the conversation transitions, they prepare to showcase weapons in the game, warning viewers about the appearance of an underdressed avatar during the demonstration, and emphasize the organization of in-game assets and weapon categories as critical for gameplay and marketing.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=1500) In this section, the discussion focuses on various weapons being introduced in the game Cornucopius, including the double-named gun called the Double Dragon and the Tiger M9, a typical battle rifle. The team emphasizes the sound design process, mentioning that they recorded audio of multiple real firearms to provide an authentic experience in the game, as opposed to using stock sounds. Additionally, they introduce the Bornley HD7, a machine gun that uses a 7.62 round and is typically used for suppressive fire. The urgency of using these weapons in-game arises from the presence of rifts threatening Cornucopius, with players compelled to defend their land by shutting down these rifts for rewards and rare loot. Although there are plans for gameplay features like improved accuracy when bracing weapons, those are not yet implemented, but the focus remains on creating an engaging combat experience within the context of the game's ongoing challenges.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=1800) In this section, the discussion focuses on the customization and upgrading of weapons within the game. Players purchase NFT weapon items that come with specific features, similar to how a real-life firearm might include standard accessories. As players progress, they can acquire non-NFT attachments to enhance their weapons' capabilities, such as increased magazine size or accuracy. The weapons are designed to be functional and ergonomic, incorporating realistic aesthetics rather than overly complex sci-fi elements. Furthermore, the presentation of different weapon types, including colorful and themed designs, highlights their uniqueness and rarity, while modifications maintain the weapon's color scheme. Finally, there is a mention of how rarity affects the visual appeal of weapons without compromising their performance.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=2100) In this section, the discussion revolves around the game mechanics of weaponry, particularly regarding different rarity levels and their impacts on gameplay. It is emphasized that while higher rarity gear, such as mythic weapons, may offer aesthetic appeal and potential experience bonuses, the performance remains balanced to avoid a pay-to-win scenario. Specifically, the conversation highlights the features of two versions of the M9 handgun and introduces the "meat grinder," a powerful 10-gauge shotgun capable of devastating single shots. The strategy behind weapon choice is explored, noting that heavier weapons like the meat grinder have drawbacks, such as slower reload times and reduced mobility, prompting players to consider their tactics. The excerpt also hints at potential future developments in the game, including the possibility of vehicles, while weaving in some lore about the origins of the weaponry.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=2400) In this section, the discussion revolves around the upcoming features and improvements in the game, particularly focusing on the new avatar designs and the associated gameplay mechanics. The presenters are excited about showcasing the new character avatar, which boasts enhanced visuals, as well as some elements that still need work, such as certain clothing details. They also touch on the introduction of a new training segment, hinting at challenging future releases involving enemy threats in the game. The segment includes a demonstration of weapon usage and enemy targeting in a testing environment, emphasizing the need for players to prepare for these new challenges. Moreover, a special cinematic related to the game is mentioned, promising exciting future content.
* [**00:45:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A6BOHrXlOPE&t=2700) In this section, the conversation focuses on the performance aspects of a shooting game, highlighting ongoing adjustments to improve recoil and accuracy. The speaker expresses enthusiasm about the gameplay experience and mentions efforts to prepare for a release soon, hinting at future cinematic content related to the game. There is a moment of camaraderie around the anticipation for upcoming features, ending with a friendly farewell to the audience.
