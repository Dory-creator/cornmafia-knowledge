* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=0) In this section the Cornucopias team welcome the Corn Community and discuss the second day of the conference. They mention the fun and hard work involved in filming conferences and share their experiences from the previous night's event. As they transition to the topic of the Cornucopias game, they express the importance of having a booth at Consensus as part of their cross-chain strategy. The team has learned and evolved since their initial conference setups, now featuring four player screens and a large central screen showcasing footage from the game. The interactive and fast-moving nature of the booth, along with the large crowds, has helped Cornucopias stand out at the conference. The hosts also mention that they have received numerous questions from attendees about the Cornucopias game.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=300) In this section the speakers discuss their game, Cornucopias, and the positive reactions they've received during the event. They mention that many attendees were surprised to find the web 3 game and were impressed by the graphics and gameplay. The team also talks about the benefits of being part of the decentralized finance (DePin) trend and the importance of user experience and onboarding. The team mention they are currently testing the registration process for nodes, which will go live on July 1st.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=600) In this section the speaker discusses the rollout plan for the decentralized file nodes. The process will be divided into three phases: downloading software, testing, and running nodes. The speaker also mentions that they have sold over 7,500 out of 20,000 nodes so far. The file node project aims to decentralize gaming infrastructure by allowing users to download games within minutes instead of hours through their decentralized nodes. A professional filmmaker has been brought on board to record the event, marking the first time this has been done, and the expected outcome is high-quality footage to help spread the project's content and reach a larger audience.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=900) In this section Farid of dApp Central (the host) asks about the importance of professionalism in the Cornucopias project and the introduction of leaderboards as a game reward system. The speaker explains that professionalism has been a priority for Cornucopias since the beginning, with a focus on high-quality content and production. The introduction of leaderboards marks a turning point for the project, providing incentives for users to play the game and paving the way for future Esports league trials. The speaker also welcomes a special guest, Tobias, who is a senior environment artist for Cornucopias.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=1200) In this section Tobias discusses the challenges of creating realistic digital water for their game using Unreal Engine. He explains that digital water requires a lot of mathematical calculations and research into how nature works, and the team prefers to create their own water assets instead of purchasing marketplace ones to ensure consistency and performance. The team has been working on creating lakes, rivers, and waterfalls, and they have made significant progress, showcasing a remarkable water leak in the game. The speaker expresses amazement at the talent on their team and looks forward to the completion of the water effects, including rivers and waterfalls, which will be shown after Consensus.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sf6eLWPQjbs&t=1500) In this section Tobias, also known as Toby, shares his feelings about attending the event in person after working with the team for over 1.5 years. He expresses his excitement about finally visiting the United States and meeting his colleagues face-to-face. Tobias mentions that he has worked with industry connections, including a co-founder from Star Citizen, and is grateful for the opportunity to bring the team together. He also shares that he has been with the company since its early days and has contributed significantly to the project, including designing track art for [Calido Valley](/gameplay/mega-dome-calido-valley). The team expresses their gratitude for Tobias's presence and moves on to share customer testimonials.
