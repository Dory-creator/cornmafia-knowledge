Rarities Formatting
-------------------

The table below shares the rarity and distribution method

**Good to know:** The current Asset design has a **Rarity Status** and a **Color Band** at the bottom, this is what is referred to in the chart below.

1. **Common** [White / #FFFFFF] **-** Accounts for **45%** of all Asset batches.
2. **Uncommon** [Green / #99CC00] **-** Accounts for **27%** of all Asset batches.
3. **Rare** [Blue / #00CCFF] **-**Accounts for **18%** of all Asset batches.
4. **Legendary** [Pink / #FF00FF] **-** Accounts for **9%** of all Asset batches.
5. **Mythic** [Orange / #DF9326] **-** Accounts for **1%** of all Asset batches.

**Note:** The color of the Asset can be anything; only the **Color Band** is being described here. See examples below

### Example 1 - Rare Asset

The diagram below shows the text RARE and the blue band

-------------------------

#### The maximum number of Assets for each mint that has rarities is always divisible by 100 and the items are pre-ordered to ensure a fair distribution.

Unless otherwise stated, the steps for ensuring rarity minting distribution work as follows:

1. A list of 100 Assets items is created in a batch using the rarity chart below. i.e. The list of 100x Assets has 45x Common, 27x Uncommon, 18x Rare, 9x Legendary and 1x Mythic Asset.
2. The list is then scrambled and added to a master list.
3. Step 1 is repeated until the maximum number of Assets have been added to the master list.

The above process should ensure that if the mint was stopped or paused part way through, the best effort would have been made to maintain the rarity distribution.

**Minting Distribution and Testing Notes:**

* Using the above process,it is highly unlikely that more than 10x Common Assets are minted in a row.
* It is possible to have 2x Mythic Assets minted one after another, but this has never been reproduced during testing. For this to happen, the randomization process would have had to place the only Mythic from 1 batch into position 100 and then place the only Mythic from the next batch at position 1. Theoretically possible but extremely rare.
* It is impossible to have 3 Mythic Assets minted in a row.
