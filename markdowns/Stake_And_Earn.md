Stake-and-Earn
==============

Staking is a way of earning rewards for holding a specific amount of COPI tokens in staking pools for a predetermined period of time. This allows users to gain a return on assets, which would otherwise be unproductive by just staying in wallets. 

There are two types of staking currently available:

* [Token Staking](/gameplay/about-the-game/stake-and-earn/stake-and-earn-token-staking)
* [NFT Staking](/gameplay/about-the-game/stake-and-earn/stake-and-earn-properties)

### Rewards

Cornucopias will incentivize platform participants via its reward pool. The exact actions which will be incentivized and exact inventive amounts will be up for governance. The rewards are distributed from a fixed supply reward pool. 

These rewards include; [$COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi), [NFTs](/blockchain/player-owned-assets), and [in-game resources](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/resources).
