District - Leagues and Leader board
===================================

Each district will be assigned to a district league depending on the level of the district. All these districts will be ranked on a leader board each season and will be competing against other districts to win the district league.

At the beginning of each season, the district score will be reset to zero and a basic status will be assigned.

Through district activity, the community will improve the districts score and the best performing districts will be in with a chance to earn rewards for their district and residents.

There are a number of ways to increase the district score: 

* District population fluctuations.
* Balance of production and consumption.
* Commerce activity.
* Quests and challenges completed.

Districts will be ranked on a League table and the most active and successful districts will rise to the top. There will be rewards for the top districts at the end of the season.

At the end of the season, a snapshot of the districts scores will be taken and rewards handed out to all the current occupants of the districts. 

**Please Note:** not all occupants will receive rewards - rewards will be given to the top performers in the districts and those that have a minimum occupancy; i.e., you can‚Äôt just rent a property on the last day of the season in a top performing district and expect to get a share in the districts rewards.

After the rewards have been delivered to the players, the district score will be reset back to zero and the process will repeat for the next season.
