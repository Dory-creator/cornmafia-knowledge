Themed Zones
============

The Cornucopias Metaverse will be comprised of twelve unique Themed Zones. A Themed Zone is a system of [Sectors](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors). The Sectors encompass vast landscapes with their own unique style and backstory housed in immense floating Domes. 

 Players can travel to the Themed Zones through the [Cloud Gates](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/cloud-gates).

Users can [Play-and-Earn](/gameplay/about-the-game/play-and-earn) by engaging in various mini-games, where they are rewarded with in-game currency, rewards or $COPI. 

Furthermore, players can [Build-and-Earn](/gameplay/about-the-game/build-and-earn) by developing skills to harness [resources](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/resources) and craft valuable items.

Of the twelve themed zones that will be built, three have been announced and available to play when the game first launches: 

* [Solace](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-1-solace)
* [Esperanza](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-2-esperanza)
* [Fortune](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-3-fortune)

Having less Sectors per Themed Zone means less development time, which improves delivery times.

We are always testing and the current plan is to try and have 3 Sectors per Themed Zone - this may increase again as build, planning and testing continues.
