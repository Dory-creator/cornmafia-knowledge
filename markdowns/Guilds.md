Guilds
======

A Guild is an association of players with mutual interests, practices and ethos in pursuit of a common goal. 

Within Cornucopias, [Custom Domes](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/custom-domes) can be used to create guild halls where members can join. 

Certain guilds may form for casual players seeking a social experience. Alternatively, certain guilds accommodate dedicated players seeking to earn rewards through success in guild leagues. 

Guilds will have control over various valuable [NFT assets](/blockchain/player-owned-assets) in Cornucopias. These assets will be temporarily distributed between guild members for a selected period of time. This creates the incentive for players to join certain Guilds.

More information about guilds will be added here in the future. For now, the best information is in the guild channel within [Discord](/gameplay/community/discord).
