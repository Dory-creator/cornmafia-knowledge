October 2022
============

**Summary**
-----------


> **Delivery, public meet-ups, networking, Las Vegas​ + Denver public conference - cNFTcon & Web3Expo and RareBloom**

October was an incredible month for Cornucopias, with 11 of the team attending the first ever live annual [cNFTcon](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/cnftcon-2022) event in Las Vegas and the 4x founders attending the [Web3Expo](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/web3expo-2022) (Las Vegas) and [RareBloom](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/rarebloom-2022) event in Denver, Colorado.

Showing off 2x playable, multi-player demos in Las Vegas was a "coming-of-age" for Cornucopias during the 12 days in America with the highlight being the CEO of IOG Charles Hoskinson playing the racing game demo which is foreshadowing the launch of the First eSports platform on Cardano coming in early 2023.

See October [roadmap](/gameplay/about-the-game/road-map) for more information on what we've been up to.

At the start of October we achieved the 58m ₳ staked milestone in the COPI StakePool from over 4600 delegates.

**The COPI Stakepool produced over 200 blocks in October !**

### BUSINESS​

Finally on 31st October 2022 the Binance to Cardano / Cardano to Binance bridge developed by [ChainPort](/the-company/partners/partners-strategic-technology/chainport) and Cornucopias went live, allowing the $COPI token (and any other Cardano Native token) to be sent back and too from the Layer 1 Blockchains where the [$COPI Token](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) can be found - Cardano & Binance. 

**A HUGE MILESTONE FOR CORNUCOPIAS AND CARDANO**

We continue to look at growing the team and building the UE5 Metaverse Game.

Rob announced we are creating a new UE5 Mobile game on a [YouTube interview with dApp Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn35IXpmumU).

0x new employees joined the Cornucopias internal team in October 2022.

### AOB

The events at [cNFTcon](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/cnftcon-2022), [Web3Expo](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/web3expo-2022) and [RareBloom](/gameplay/community/status-updates/status-updates-2022/october-2022/rarebloom-2022) were great for not only showing off what Cornucopias is building, but also for making new connections with Cardano Projects and other companies looking to have a presence in the Metaverse. Watch this space for more partnership announcements.

Now that the Vasil hard-fork has occurred on Cardano, the COPI Token bridge being built by ChainPort is ready to be deployed. 

**The Cardano Native Token Bridge was launched on 31st October 2022 - new** Cornucopias-led **infrastructure was introduced to the so-called ‌"Ghost Chain" on Halloween!**
