NFT Staking
===========

NFT Staking is a way to earn [$COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) and in-game rewards/assets for staking your [NFT](/blockchain/player-owned-assets) assets.

When staking your NFTs, similar to Cardano ADA Staking, your NFTs do not need to leave your wallet (beware of scammers asking you to send them your assets).

The rarity of your NFT may have an effect on the number of $COPI Tokens or in-game rewards you will receive.

In the past and in the future you would have and maybe able to stake the following NFTs:

* [Themed Zone Land](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-themed-zones-1-3)
* [Flying Vehicles](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/flying-vehicles)
* [Custom Dome Land](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/custom-domes)

\* NFT Land Staking was launched on 20th August 2022 with our partners [DripDropz](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/dripdropz) managing the distribution of [$COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) to owners of the Themed Zone Land Plot NFTs.

Other NFT staking options will appear in the future. Watch this space.
