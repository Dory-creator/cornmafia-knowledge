Episode 119 -Crafting Gameplay
==============================

In episode 119 of COPI Café, Rob and Josh delve into the upcoming open-world MMO "Cornucopias," where players thrive in a vibrant sky world filled with advanced dome structures on floating islands. 

Plans for gameplay enhancements are discussed, including the introduction of new crafting buildings, diverse animal species, and server infrastructure improvements to allow scalable multiplayer experiences. 

The team highlights an exciting partnership with Superverse aimed at boosting visibility. 

Other features teased include expanded combat zones, community-driven ideas, and a comprehensive asset library for players. As they prepare for internal testing and alpha release, the hosts express enthusiasm for the game's evolving immersive environment and encourage the community to engage actively during this development phase.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=0) The episode features discussions about upcoming updates, including infrastructure improvements and a significant partnership, as well as technical advancements from migrating to Unreal Engine 5.5.3 to enhance gameplay quality. The hosts also hint at exciting new crafting options and information coming soon for the game's next build.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=300) In this section, the discussion centers on the upcoming enhancements for crafting mechanics within the game, with plans to introduce two crafting buildings per town and a new programmer dedicated to this aspect. Various building types are being planned, including stonemasons and blacksmiths, alongside agricultural and scientific facilities to diversify gameplay. The conversation also highlights the introduction of different animal species in the environment, with specific ones being unique to various zones, enhancing the hunting and crafting experiences. The team is currently progressing rapidly on environmental details for the upcoming areas, particularly Esparanza, aiming for a release by Q2 that will allow for internal gameplay testing. Lastly, they mention the server infrastructure improvements that will enhance the gaming experience.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=600) In this section, the discussion focuses on the infrastructure and server management solutions developed for the game, which aim to enhance scalability and performance. The team has created a custom solution that allows multiple players to participate across different levels without relying on a single server. This setup enables them to launch multiple instances for different game modes, automatically scaling based on player demand, which could potentially accommodate hundreds of thousands of players simultaneously. They opted against pre-built platforms like GameLift due to limitations for their specific use case—a persistent world combined with session-based gameplay—necessitating a tailored approach. Additionally, the shift to decentralized file node updates has been successfully implemented, with community members managing nodes worldwide, promoting enhanced security and distribution of game data. This robust infrastructure positions them well for a significant marketing push as they approach their Alpha release.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=900) In this section, the team discusses the launch of the game and the invitation for new node operators to join, emphasizing that now is the perfect time to set up nodes as performance rewards will soon be implemented. They encourage the community to uninstall the existing game and download it again for a stress test to prepare for the next build. The conversation then shifts to an exciting new partnership with Superverse, co-founded by influential figures in the gaming space, which is expected to expose the game to a broader audience while enhancing the utility of the COPI token. The team hopes to incorporate COPI for all in-game transactions by the end of the year and is strategizing to attract new players by offering select NFTs and assets to those outside the existing token ecosystem, thereby potentially increasing demand for COPI.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around the utility and marketing benefits of partnerships in the game, highlighting the introduction of new tokens and possible cross-project NFTs, which will enhance the gaming experience. The conversation also teases upcoming features related to combat, showcasing a work-in-progress Armory with various weapons and gear. The hosts express enthusiasm for including community ideas, such as a bacon burger potentially named after a community member, while clarifying that glimpses of new areas like Esperanza will be featured in future updates. Additionally, they answer questions about community resources, indicating that logos for personal use can be found on their website.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=1500) In this section, the hosts discuss the asset library available on their website, emphasizing the inclusion of branding materials and various game visuals that community members are encouraged to use freely. They address a question about the game's combat zones, revealing that there will be dedicated fighting areas as well as free-roam zones where unexpected encounters may occur. The hosts mention a new shooting range and other potential combat activities, outlining that some areas will serve as safe zones while others may present risks from creatures or player confrontations. They reassure players that they can choose to remain in safe zones if they prefer to avoid combat, and conclude by hinting at the exciting new updates in the upcoming build, which will enhance gameplay significantly.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PBatELp9t88&t=1800) In this section, the speaker discusses the various buildings that will be visible across different towns in the game, suggesting a diverse and immersive environment. They also mention a personal distraction from their dog, which is growling in the background, indicating a moment of light-heartedness amid the discussion about the game's crafting gameplay.
