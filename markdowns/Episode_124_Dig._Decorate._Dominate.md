* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=0) Rob and Josh introduce "Cornucopias," a cutting-edge MMORPG that presents a vibrant world where humanity has ascended to create stunning floating islands within advanced dome structures high above the clouds. Players are invited to customize their avatars and engage in diverse activities, ranging from crafting and combat to exploration in this immersive environment. The episode features discussions about new elements like the nodes dashboard, which helps users track and evaluate public nodes' performance and capacity, thus enhancing collaborative gameplay. The hosts, Rob and Josh, also share their drink of choice while building excitement for upcoming topics, including interviews and game mechanics like combat and mining.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=300) In this section, the discussion revolves around the public and private pools within the Cornucopias ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of transparency. Public pools are searchable and visible to users, whereas private pools cater to those who prefer to operate independently. Key metrics like check-in counts, request success rates, and delegation counts are highlighted to ensure users can assess pool performance effectively. The speakers note that the current reward system is evenly split among node holders, but future changes will incentivize quality node operation to enhance user experience. They encourage users to set up nodes as the platform is still developing and will evolve based on feedback. The conversation transitions to a guest appearance by David - Game Director, touching on crafting and the interrelated aspects of crafting and mining, hinting at upcoming features in future releases.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=600) In this section, the team discusses upcoming plans for the crafting system within their game, emphasizing the work Georgia has contributed since joining the project. They clarify that the crafting mechanism will be more intricate than typical systems seen in games like Minecraft, currently requiring a basic user interface that still needs polishing. Players will gather resources through mining, process raw materials using a "mining processor," and eventually utilize crafting benches to create goods that can drive an in-game economy. Although they are excited about the features being implemented, they stress the importance of flexibility in their timeline due to the complexities and ongoing changes in game development, making it difficult to provide an expected release date.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=900) In this section, the developers discuss the complexities and challenges they face in releasing new features for their game, particularly highlighting issues related to the avatar system and the synergy required between different systems such as combat and mining. They note that while they aim to release updates smoothly, unexpected bugs can arise, delaying progress. The team addresses specific concerns about the upcoming Avatar 3.0 update causing comparable issues to previous versions. The conversation also touches on the mining feature, suggesting an initial release with one or two mines as a test rather than a broader rollout, emphasizing the need for player feedback before expanding the feature into multiple areas. Overall, the developers convey that while there are many intricacies involved in development, they are making good progress.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around upcoming builds in the game, emphasizing the development of a mining level and the building system, which will include apartments and land plots. The same master system underpins both apartments and plots, though each has different capabilities and limitations. The team highlights the importance of timing with land claims, suggesting that players should wait until the building system is functional before claiming land. They note that while apartment buildings will allow for detailed customization similar to games like The Sims, land plots will require careful management of performance due to potential loading issues. Players will start with free smaller apartments, helping to onboard casual users, and there's mention of a hub area designed to accommodate a large number of players, which aims to offer unique real estate experiences.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=1500) In this section, the discussion revolves around the unique gameplay experiences within the virtual world of Cornucopias, focusing on player housing and rift combat features. Players will have personalized apartments, each offering distinct views, and can navigate quickly between different properties and neighborhoods. The conversation then shifts to upcoming combat elements, particularly rift challenges where players will tackle enemies emerging from rifts to protect their environment. There's also mention of training areas, which serve as preparation for players before facing rift combat, alongside the introduction of "terror tunnels" designed for skill enhancement. The developers express excitement about the future potential of these features while emphasizing the balance between building and combat within the game.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=1800) In this section, the discussion revolves around the potential implementation of leaderboards in the game and the impact of AI on game development. The team considers the necessity of leaderboards amidst ongoing project demands and questions whether delaying the current build for this feature is worth it. They acknowledge community interest in gamified elements but note that the leaderboard may be pushed to future updates. Additionally, concerns are raised about AI's ability to create games, with a focus on its limitations in producing high-quality 3D assets and the importance of maintaining a unique and performant game environment. The team expresses their proactive use of AI tools where applicable but reiterates that for complex, multiplayer games, AI alone cannot replace the intricate processes and quality standards they aim to achieve in their work.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=2100) In this section, the speaker discusses the current limitations of AI in the context of game development, particularly for complex projects like Cornucopias. They highlight that while AI can assist in areas like texturing and animations, it falls short in crucial aspects like 3D modeling and programming due to a lack of reliability and potential for misinformation. Despite these challenges, the speaker acknowledges the importance of AI in streamlining some processes, acting as a second memory, and potentially aiding in future game development. They emphasize that while AI might lower the barriers to entry in the industry, leading to increased competition based on community engagement, game development remains a demanding field requiring extensive labor to meet consumer expectations. As such, there is optimism that AI could help alleviate some of the pressures developers face in the future.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=2400) In this section, the discussion focuses on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on game development and the perceived value of games. The speakers emphasize that while AI can streamline certain processes, it could lead to a saturation of games, diminishing their value to consumers. They highlight that games crafted by human teams with consistent lore, art style, and technology will hold more appeal compared to those generated by AI without thoughtful curation. The conversation then shifts to the game's impending listing on platforms like Epic Games, detailing the planned stages for release, from creating excitement with a trailer to a soft launch followed by a hard launch if the game's reception is favorable.
* [**00:45:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=2700) In this section, the developers discuss the early access release of their game, addressing concerns about its incomplete status and outlining upcoming features. They confirm that gun maintenance will be integrated in the future, with weapons potentially showing signs of wear and requiring upkeep. Additionally, they explain that while there won't be an inventory weight limit, gear and equipment will impact player mobility. Heavier armor and weapons will slow movement and jump speed but increase damage absorption. This balancing system allows players to choose between lightweight, agile characters and heavily armed tank-like configurations, aiming to enhance strategic gameplay during missions.
* [**00:50:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7cJ5v3ie7E0&t=3000) In this section, the discussion revolves around the strategic importance of selecting the right equipment, particularly backpacks and weapon types, in a combat scenario. Various packs, including shield and offensive weapon packs, enhance gameplay by allowing players to adapt their loadouts for different situations, such as flying with a jetpack or navigating tight spaces without one. The conversation also transitions to a current sale in the marketplace, where the speakers highlight several weapons, including the Komaru Defense Tiger M9s and an impressive high-capacity energy weapon. They encourage viewers to check out the sale and express excitement about specific items, especially a unique meat grinder weapon, while inviting the community to participate.
