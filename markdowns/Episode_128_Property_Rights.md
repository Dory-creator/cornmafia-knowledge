Episode 128 - Property Rights
=============================

In episode 128 of COPI Café, Rob and Josh highlight game improvements such as new combat features, the extension of Aero Trails, and the highly anticipated land grab event, emphasizing their commitment to meaningful gameplay and player empowerment through property ownership. 

They explore the dynamic nature of property rights, enabling players to relocate properties flexibly, while addressing community governance through town management systems that foster collaboration among players. 

The discussion also covers the balancing of NFTs and NPCs within the game’s environment, the transition to a more regular staking pool, and the optimistic outlook towards launching with Epic Games. 

With nearly two years with a Live pre-alpha game running 24/7, the show wraps up with excitement about the forthcoming alpha release and ongoing visual enhancements, indicating a robust future for the game akin to a metaverse.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=0) In this section, the hosts Rob and Josh provide a build update for the game, mentioning ongoing progress with Avatar 3.0 and efforts to resolve combat and technical issues, including an upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.5.4. The team is enthusiastic about the developments and is gearing up for new builds while acknowledging the rigorous testing process ahead. The discussion includes light-hearted banter about beverages, creating a relaxed atmosphere as they delve into the game's features and community engagement.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=300) In this section, the discussion focuses on the advanced capabilities of the Avatar 3.0 builder, highlighting its uniqueness among the limited number of games that offer such a complex avatar creation system. The speakers express excitement about the potential for upcoming avatar creator contests that will allow players to compare old and new creations, showcasing the significant improvements of the new builder. Additionally, they touch upon updates to game features like holocaches and rumble ball, noting challenges faced in game mechanics and physics adjustments to enhance gameplay. The conversation emphasizes the ambition behind these features while acknowledging the technical difficulties involved in creating a high-quality gaming experience.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=600) In this section, the speakers discuss recent developments and upcoming features for the game, highlighting improvements to the Aero Trails, which have been slightly extended, and the possibility of adding new trails within an area called Solace. They express excitement about various enhancements in the current build, including new combat features, a Terra tunnel, and drone shooting mechanics. The speakers address the much-anticipated land grab event, explaining that while the technical groundwork is mostly ready, they wish to ensure meaningful gameplay experiences associated with property ownership before the official launch. They assure viewers that they are making progress and promise to announce a release date soon, confirming that the event will indeed occur within the current year.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=900) In this section, the discussion revolves around enhancing player empowerment within the Cornucopias game, specifically regarding land ownership and gameplay mechanics. The team emphasizes their commitment to enabling players to manage their properties and maintain active community zones, tackling issues related to underpopulated areas even when all land has been sold. They explore ideas allowing players to move properties, with the understanding that players’ assets will remain intact during relocations. This flexibility aims to enrich gameplay by introducing new strategies and social interactions among players. Additionally, there are considerations for property availability based on players’ engagement, while also acknowledging the challenges of maintaining vibrant in-game communities amidst the complexities of property ownership in a web3 environment.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around the dynamic nature of property rights within the game, emphasizing the ability to move properties between different locations without permanent commitment. This flexibility allows players to adapt their gaming experience according to their preferences, reducing the fear of "missing out" on better land opportunities in new areas. The speaker explains that while there are maintenance requirements akin to real-life property taxes, they aim to make the upkeep reasonable for players. Additionally, the mention of NFT transfers highlights how new owners must adhere to the same property management rules to retain their assets. The conversation also touches on the community's empowerment through potential governance mechanisms, indicating a gradual move towards player-driven decision-making in the game's ecosystem.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=1500) In this section, the discussion revolves around the establishment of towns within the game, focusing on the role of a town governor and the collaborative nature of community interactions. The governor is responsible for enhancing the town by managing amenities and setting fee structures for land ownership, enabling a strategic gameplay experience. This encourages community engagement, allowing players to move between towns based on their satisfaction with governance. Players will participate in decisions related to town upgrades and metrics, fostering a competitive yet cooperative environment. Additionally, the concept includes earning NFTs through gameplay, with some governed by Cornucopia itself to ensure a vibrant community. The ongoing complexity of these systems highlights the continuous iteration and feedback necessary to align player interests with game mechanics.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=1800) In this section, the discussion revolves around developments in the gaming environment within Solace, including how populated areas will be created with a balance between NFTs and NPCs to enhance gameplay fairness. A question about the 30-day window for collecting rewards from the [COPIC](/blockchain/copic-stake-pool) stake pool is addressed, indicating the transition to a regular stake pool structure that still offers rewards. Additionally, progress on launching with Epic Games is covered, with a positive expectation that it will happen before year-end, while not all zones will be available by then, although specific features like crafting and mining are in progress. The conversation highlights the parallel work on various foundational systems, including apartment builders, which are essential for future developments in custom domes and land functionalities.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tLbncRmyRDw&t=2100) In this section, the discussion revolves around the progress and future developments of a gaming project, emphasizing its ambition to create a robust digital environment akin to a metaverse. The speakers highlight how the game has been live for nearly two years in pre-alpha, allowing players to engage with its features long before traditional games would reveal their developments. As they prepare for an alpha release which will introduce foundational gameplay elements, they anticipate a significant influx of players. The conversation touches on plans for marketing, the iterative addition of content, and the transition to a shorter beta period for further refinement. They also express excitement over the current build's visual updates before concluding the episode.
