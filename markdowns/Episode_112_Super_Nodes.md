Episode 112 - Super Nodes
=========================

In Episode 112 of [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) the hosts Rob and Josh discuss the latest goings on in the land of Cornucopias. 

Central to the discussion is the Juggernaut vehicle, highlighted for its impressive cargo capacity and five rarity levels, priced at $350, with a whitelist granting early access based on "corn points." 

They also explore the ongoing development of nodes within the community, focusing on improved download speeds and regional structuring to enhance user experience and minimize latency. 

The speakers emphasize community participation, especially through node operation and testing, while discussing affordable solutions like Raspberry Pi devices and the importance of custom art in game development to ensure a unique gaming experience.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=0) In this section, the hosts discuss the upcoming sale featuring new vehicles like the Juggernaut cargo ship and the Class A Sunset Speeder. The hosts elaborate on the Juggernaut's specifications, including its impressive cargo capacity and powerful engines, while also highlighting the immersive gameplay experience players can expect as they navigate this vibrant and expansive world.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=300) In this section, the discussion revolves around a specialized vehicle known as the Juggernaut, which is part of a gaming ecosystem and will be released in five rarities. While the vehicle is described as a juggernaut and expected to be slow, players can fly between domes or zones in the game. Key details include a price of $350, with a total supply of 760 vehicles available split over the Cardano and Base blockchains. A whitelist allowing early access for those who have collected a certain number of "corn points" is introduced, along with an announcement that these points are merging with engage points to streamline participation rewards. The section concludes with a visual overview of the Juggernaut, emphasizing its size and detailing a cautious reminder to purchase only through verified channels to avoid scams.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=600) In this section, the speakers discuss an upcoming sale event and provide updates on the progress of nodes within the Cornucopias community. Greg, a returning guest, expresses enthusiasm about his experiences in the community and details the launch of a limited test group for nodes, which currently includes 32 operational nodes. They emphasize the expectation of expanding this number significantly over the next year, highlighting the involvement of community members in testing various setups. Additionally, the group outlines the integration of an internal launcher for their testing process, with the hope of swiftly moving toward a wider release for the community, while noting the efficiency and excitement of testers using new internal builds.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=900) In this section, the discussion focuses on the improvements in download speeds stemming from recent optimizations in node design and regional structuring. The speakers highlight an impressive case where a user in Europe downloaded a substantial amount of data within five minutes, demonstrating the effectiveness of these changes. They explain the importance of minimizing latency by organizing nodes into closer geographical regions—currently three regions (Chicago, London, and Newark)—which helps reduce errors and improve connectivity. The goal is to create a more balanced system that allows users to access the closest nodes for downloading, thereby lowering costs and enhancing performance. Overall, the team is optimistic about these advancements and is continually fine-tuning the structure for better efficiency.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=1200) In this section, the discussion revolves around the ongoing development and optimization of node pools and super pools, emphasizing the importance of location and data management in enhancing network performance. The team is in the process of gathering data to establish reward metrics based on node activity and community feedback. They acknowledge the need for a user-friendly dashboard for node operators to monitor their pool performance and promise transparency regarding developments. Additionally, they share insights into the current state of active pools and data usage, revealing statistics such as download rates and the increasing size of their game data. The segment highlights the team's commitment to improving user experience and network efficiency through data analysis and community engagement.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=1500) In this section, the discussion focuses on the infrastructure of the Cornucopias game and how participants can contribute by operating nodes and testing software, with the incentive of being rewarded in tokens. The conversation includes technical details about the network's performance metrics, such as success rates and download times, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve efficiency. The speakers also encourage existing node holders to get involved in testing, providing instructions on how to reach out through Discord. Additionally, they mention the diverse range of devices being tested, including Windows, Linux, Mac, and even a Raspberry Pi, showcasing the collaborative spirit of the community and the importance of support training within it.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=1800) In this section, the discussion revolves around the affordability and practicality of using Raspberry Pi devices for running nodes within the network, highlighting that they can be purchased for under $200. The speakers express optimism about supporting Raspberry Pi as a viable option for users who wish to run single node pools without impacting their home networks' performance. They mention ongoing testing to determine the feasibility of Raspberry Pi and other under $300 PCs for this purpose. Additionally, there's mention of alternative cloud-based solutions through VPS for those who prefer a more robust infrastructure. The speakers emphasize community involvement in this process and the utility of delegating nodes to public pools for those looking for a hands-off approach.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=2100) In this section, the discussion focuses on the development of technology that allows users to manage their nodes effortlessly, highlighting the transition towards a more user-friendly interface. Greg shares his excitement about the project and community engagement. The conversation then shifts to various gameplay elements in the upcoming Solace environment, including farming, where players will need to own land plots for certain features like growing crops. Questions also address the NFT phases, indicating that items for sale will rotate out with fixed supplies, ensuring exclusivity for certain items. Lastly, the use of assets in game development is clarified, affirming that while all art-based assets are created from scratch, some programming elements may utilize existing code to enhance workflow.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=2400) In this section, the team discusses their approach to balancing speed and quality in game development, emphasizing the importance of custom art assets to create a unique gaming experience. They acknowledge the complexity of integrating external programming tools and plugins, noting that while these can be helpful for prototyping, they often require significant modifications to fit their specific needs and can lead to compatibility issues during engine upgrades. The conversation highlights the risks of relying on third-party assets, as many of these may not be regularly updated, resulting in potential functionality loss when transitioning to new software versions. Overall, they stress the necessity of a well-coordinated codebase to maintain the integrity and cohesion of their game's features.
* [**00:45:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FyrMKOdphg8&t=2700) In this section, the hosts conclude episode 112 of COPICafe, expressing their gratitude to the viewers and encouraging them to look forward to upcoming content available in the marketplace. The segment wraps up with an upbeat musical interlude, highlighting the engaging atmosphere of the show as they hint at more exciting developments in the future.
