Jennifer Donahoe who has just joined the new Cornucopias board shares her background in the toy industry and transition into the video game industry, emphasizing the importance of authentic engagement and decentralized marketplaces for players. She discusses new ways to engage communities through technology, specifically mentioning Windwalk's gamified platform. The team also answers viewer questions and provides information on jetpack models.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss Cornucopias. They describe it as a cutting-edge game set in a world where humanity has ascended to the sky, creating floating islands with unique environments and thriving communities. Players can explore these islands and engage in various activities such as crafting, commerce, combat, racing, and more. The developers are currently working on refining and optimizing the game's backend systems, with plans to invite testers to try it out and eventually release it to the public by the end of the year. Additionally, the team is discussing the implementation of a Game Pass and seasonality features, and they welcome a special guest, Jen from their Board of Advisers, to join the show.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=300) In this section the speaker announces the upcoming sale of assets on both the Cardano and Base chains, with the sale starting on Wednesday, 23rd October 2024, and lasting approximately three weeks. The speaker expresses excitement about this being the first step towards their tokenomics plan, which includes accepting $COPI token for some assets and eventually making all assets for sale with the $COPI token. The sale is also described as the third version of the Marketplace, which is multi-chain and geared towards selling multiple items with a fixed quantity. The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding how the marketplace functions on both chains and which assets are popular among users. Additionally, the speaker mentions the release of the game pass or Early Access pass, which makes it easier for newcomers to join the game by paying a $10 fee and creating a better first impression.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=600) In this section the creators discuss changes to the accessibility of their game. They have moved away from a fully gated experience, allowing new players to pay with a credit card for early access. This is not a significant revenue source at present but helps offset costs and integrate credit cards into their marketplace. The game will eventually be free to play. Additionally, they plan to introduce seasons, starting with a Halloween theme, to keep the game fresh and engaging for players.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=900) In this section the speaker announces the next build release named "Quantum Autumn", which will include seasonal assets for Halloween. They also reveal that a free NFT helmet named Quantum Jack, which is a pumpkin helmet with moving parts, will be given away while supplies last. The team has been working hard to implement these seasonal changes and the new marketplace. Jennifer Donahoe, a new board member, joins the interview for a discussion about her background and her role in the gaming industry.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=1200) In this section Jen shares her career background, which includes a significant portion in the toy industry where they worked on creating action figures for brands like Star Wars, Batman, Transformers, and Power Rangers at companies such as Hasbro, Mattel, and Disney. Jen also mentions her love for playing video games since childhood, leading her to transition into the video games industry. After working at Electronic Arts (EA) for several years, Jen moved on to Zynga, Scopely, and Riot Games, where she led marketing for various games like Farmville, Monopoly Go, and League of Legends. Currently, she is running a consulting business and is a co-host of a podcast called "Deconstructor of Fun," where she talks about game industry news and interview industry professionals.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=1500) In this section the speaker discusses the gaming industry's perception of web 3 and NFTs, specifically in relation to Off the Grid, a game currently in extraction royale mode on Xbox, PlayStation, and the Epic Game Store. The speaker explains that many traditional gamers are "allergic" to terms like NFT and crypto, but if developers focus on reducing the friction for gamers to engage in web 3 experiences, they may be more receptive. Off the Grid, which is currently hiding all crypto and NFT elements from players, is one such attempt to introduce web 3 to traditional gamers. The game's developers are also investing heavily in marketing the game via influencers to reach a wider audience.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=1800) In this section the speaker discusses the incentives being offered to gamers and streamers in the game Off the Grid, which utilizes blockchain technology. Influencers, such as Ninja and Shroud, are participating in the game and are incentivized to continue playing due to the potential for ongoing revenue shares or royalties from the trading of skins. This approach aims to keep streamers authentically engaged with the game, avoiding the issue of players perceiving inauthenticity, as was the case with Apex Legends in the past. The speaker emphasizes the importance of authentic engagement for the success of the game and the potential benefits of decentralized marketplaces for players. The discussion also touches on the preparation for a mainstream launch and the role of community and influencers in marketing.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=2100) In this section the speaker discusses new ways to engage communities through the use of technology, specifically mentioning a company called Windwalk and its gamified platform. Windwalk rewards users for engaging with content, both in-game and out, through tokens and in-game rewards. This approach has been successful for some web 3 games, leading to significant growth in followers. The platform also integrates with various platforms like Discord, Twitter, and even Slack, allowing users to engage across multiple channels. The speaker expresses excitement about the potential of this technology for community building and marketing strategies.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=2400) In this section the speakers discuss the collaboration between their team and Jen and Philip from the Deconstructor of Fun podcast. They express their appreciation for Jen's expertise in marketing and gaming, and mention that they have learned a lot from her. The team also answers questions from viewers.
* [**00:50:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VKhLe3n40rI&t=3000) In this section the speaker discusses the temporary availability of assets in the marketplace. He explains that these items will not be permanently available and may be brought back at a later time. The speaker also mentions that the initial phase of sales will likely include these temporarily available items. The video concludes with the speaker encouraging new viewers to join their Discord community for further information and learning opportunities.
