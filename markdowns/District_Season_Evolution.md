District - Season Evolution
===========================

Districts will evolve from a basic level each season

Districts will evolve and develop based upon the success of the population of that specific district. 

To join a district, a player must own an [NFT Land](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-themed-zones-1-3) or become a [tenant](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts/district-land-plots/land-plot-property-rentals) of a property by owning a [Seasonal Tenant Key NFT](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-themed-zones-1-3/asset-seasonal-tenant-key). 

Players will be issued [Daily Challenges,](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/quest-and-challenges) each with various levels of difficulty. Upon successful completion of these challenges, the player will receive a reward and score, which contributes towards the district score. The aims is to attain the highest score possible. 

As the [season](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/seasons) progresses the district will unlock various new items that can be placed in the district to make it more appealing. As the district "Levels Up" there will be new rewards for the district population.
