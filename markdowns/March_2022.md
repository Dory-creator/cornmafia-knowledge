Cornucopias Program Level Update

**Summary**
-----------

The Cornucopias Program is on track and progressing well. The mobile game development is operating in a fully agile environment and they have completed their third two week sprint. The mobile team conducts all Agile ceremonies including planning sessions, daily stand-ups and retrospectives.

* In March the mobile development team made a demo of the upcoming P2E game for CEO Rob Greig to take to the London Valentines Crypto Networking Soiree.
* The first NFT sale was undertaken and sold out within 2 hours. The [BubbleJet Sprinter](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/bubblejett/bubblejett-sprinter-2022) sale was an overwhelming success, which provided the team at Cornucopias with a vast amount of information and details about the sale process. Within hours plenty of happy investors had placed their NFT's for sale on secondary markets, like Jpeg Store, and the next sale is in the planning stage.
* The second NFT, the [GTi Javelin](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/gti/gti-javelin-2022), was minted, and 12,400 were given away to the Cornucopias community for free - [a gift of over $1m](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/gti/usd1m-nft-giveaway) to the community.
