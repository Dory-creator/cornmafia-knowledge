Episode 109 - A Glimpse of Fear
===============================

In Episode 109 of [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) the Rob and Josh discuss the progress of Cornucopias, which offers players a vast open world with unique environments and communities. 

They also share their excitement about upcoming features, such as new vehicles, decorations, and the Nexus system. The creators also discuss improvements to the game, including new premium outfits, graphical enhancements, and animal AI. 

They introduce the concept of material cards and functional backpacks, and discuss strategies for combat. Additionally, they discuss new items, such as the Corn Cuties Backpacks and the Quantum Jack Helmet, and share their experiences wearing masks during the recording. Despite some challenges, they maintain a positive and engaging conversation throughout the episode.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss Cornucopias, set in a world where humanity has ascended to the sky and created floating islands. The hosts then switch to their regular segment, discussing drinks and the Quantum Autumn sale, with Rob opting for a coke and the Joker for Disano, a drink neither has tried before. Despite their costumes, the hosts maintain a light-hearted conversation.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=300) In this section the speakers discuss the progress of the nodes for downloading the game data. They mention that downloads have been going well, with some taking less than five minutes, despite only having nine nodes serving up the data. They also discuss plans for a Docker version, a desktop version, and allowing users to download directly from their own nodes. The speakers acknowledge the need to increase the testing group size and expect to fully pass off the game to the community by December. They also mention a DDoS attack and configuration issues that have been resolved. The Quantum Autumn build is predicted to be released soon.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=600) In this section the creators discuss the upcoming build of the game, which includes new features such as Autumn season decorations, new vehicles like the [Super Phantom](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/bubblejett/bubblejett-super-phantom-2024) and Sunset Speeder, and the introduction of the Nexus system. The Nexus system allows players to access purchased game assets through a terminal in the game. The team is excited about this build, which they believe is important and fun, with new vehicles, decorations, and the Nexus system adding to the player experience. They are currently waiting on a few final animations and NFTs before releasing the build. Despite some delays, they are confident that the build is coming together nicely and will position them for the next phase of development, which includes the game trailer, combat, and other elements.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=900) In this section the creators discuss various updates and improvements coming to the game. They introduce new premium outfits called Vanguard Scouts, both for men and women. Graphical menu enhancements have been made, resulting in better game performance. The game's graphics have been improved overall, making them more crisp and detailed, with better materials for avatars. The area previously known as "Glimpse of Solace" is now called "Glimpse of Fear," and players can look forward to experiencing Julia's story. Exciting updates are also coming for Quantum Monsters fans. The team is working on AI and navigation for the game's combat aspects, aiming to deliver an exciting community feature next year.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=1200) In this section the speaker discusses the advancements in animal AI and the addition of jetpacks in the game, which adds a new dimension to exploration and movement. The community is excited about these new features, which bring more gameplay and fun to the game. The speaker also mentions the need system and health system coming in the future, and the possibility of players getting hurt.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=1500) In this section the speakers discuss the use of Substance Painter in their game development process. They explain that Substance Painter is used to automatically texture assets at a PBR level, saving artists a significant amount of time. The team focuses on making their processes as efficient as possible to produce more assets and move quickly. Substance Painter differs from Blender in that it is used specifically for texturing, with models imported for detailed work. The team also introduces the concept of material cards, which come with premium outfits and allow players to swap materials between different outfits for customization. These material cards are not tied to NFTs, but are linked to a database.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=1800) In this section the discussion revolves around the different strategies players can employ when engaging in combat in the game. The speaker suggests having team members with various types and sizes of backpacks, such as the extra-large Titan XL, which offers the most storage space. However, the larger the backpack, the slower the movement speed. Players with stealthy playstyles might prefer light armor and a small backpack, while tank-type players may opt for heavy armor and a large backpack. The team is testing the ability to carry multiple backpacks and plans to adjust the game balance accordingly.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=2100) In this section the discussion revolves around a specific detail of the jetpack called the Quantum Compression Chamber. The jetpack uses quantum or genesium-based power and can run for a long time before needing to be recharged. When the fuel is expended, the jetpack sucks in the air around the user and reduces the oxygen to produce more propellant for the many jet engines inside. The jetpack is a recharge type item, but future versions may require fuel. The speaker also compares the jetpack to the regular [Stratos](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-packs/zero-g/zero-g-stratos-jetpack) and mentions that it is a backpack with limited inventory storage. Additionally, the topic of Quantum weapons for Quantum monsters is brought up, and the speaker confirms that such weapons are planned to help players fight these monsters more effectively. The discussion also touches on various other items in the game, including the Burger Barn hat, which may have additional utilities in the future.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ejZOWKBam0Y&t=2400) In this section the team discusses two new in-game items: [Corn Cuties](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-packs/corn-cutties) backpacks, which are cute and functional backpacks, and [Quantum Jack](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-apparel/quantum-jack-helmet), a helmet with armor rating. The corn cuties, designed by team member Katherine, have become popular due to their aesthetic appeal and storage capabilities. The team expresses excitement about the potential for these items to be made into physical products. They then introduce Quantum Jack, a free helmet given away during a sale, which comes with flaming bits that appear on the avatar. The team showcases the high-quality graphics of these items, emphasizing their attention to detail and design. They conclude the episode by wishing viewers a happy Halloween and expressing excitement for the upcoming release.
