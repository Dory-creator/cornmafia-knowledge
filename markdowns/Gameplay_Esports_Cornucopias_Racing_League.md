Gameplay - eSports Cornucopias Racing League
============================================

eSports - a first for the Cardano Blockchain

The Cornucopias Racing League is being developed alongside the main game and is based within the Cornucopias Metaverse.

Hosted in the Calido Valley [Mega Dome](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/custom-domes/mega-domes) the racing game introduces the first in-game eSports experience to Cornucopias.

Calido Valley Racecourse

It can be seen as a type of "Mini-Game" within Cornucopias with the first released version of the Racing League (the Minimal Viable Product - MVP) being based in the Mega Dome known as [Calido Valley](/gameplay/mega-dome-calido-valley). 

In the future the Racing League will also have tracks in other [Themed Zones](/gameplay/themed-zones).

### Gameplay

To begin with you will get a "Glimpse of Solace" artwork as you enter and get to run around the Mega Dome. There will be a number of activities to do here, even before the racing game begins.

Outside the Racing Stadium in an attraction called "A Glimpse of Solace"

Then when you enter the Racing Stadium the players will have a choice or Racing Tracks:

* MVP has up to 16 players racing at once
* Other Modes to follow (not MVP)

There will be a number of Racing Tracks to choose from and these will grow over time.

* Yellow Track - Easy Difficulty
* Purple Track - Medium Difficulty
* Red Track - Hard Difficulty

Players will be racing against the clock and other players throughout the Season and their times and positions will form part of a number of Leaderboards.

Players will be able to race with FREE In-Game [Flying Vehicles](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/flying-vehicles) and also be able to race with any Cornucopias [NFT](/blockchain/player-owned-assets) vehicles they may have such as:

* [Bubblejett Sprinter 2022](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/bubblejett/bubblejett-sprinter-2022)
