Episode 92 - Taking the Lead
============================

In [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) Episode 94 titled "Taking the Lead", the hosts Josh Jones and Rob Greig discuss the advancements in their open world MMO project, Cornucopias. 

The team announced changes to the SPO Stake pool bonus from 105% to 115%, aiming to build up the pool further and contribute to the Cardano network. 

They also introduced a new delegate subscription for the file nodes system, allowing those without technical abilities to have nodes run for them by public pool operators. 

Excitement builds for the upcoming Consensus conference, and the team plans to attend and network with other projects. 

The team also discusses their roles, recent work on [Solace](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-1-solace), and improvements to the land distribution system. They express excitement about the upcoming land release and the capabilities of the leaderboard system for competitions and tournaments.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=0) In this section the hosts discuss updates on the SPO Stake pool offering. The team announced last week that the bonus for staking COPI tokens was changing from 105% to 115%, which was a response to community feedback. The pool currently has a saturation level of 16 million Ada and has made nine blocks straight away. The team is aiming to build up the pool further to help decentralize the Cardano network and contribute to the infrastructure of the chain.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=300) In this section the speakers discuss the recent update to the nodes system. They explain that those without the technical ability to run their own node can now have them run by a public pool operator, who will earn additional [COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) in return. The minimum number of nodes required to be a public pool operator is eight. For every node hosted, a host will receive two delegates, with a maximum of 10 host nodes. The number of delegates per host node may increase over time. The developers are working on the node software and aim to increase decentralization while utilizing commercial-grade node software.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=600) In this section the creators discuss the differences between curated and procedurally generated land in their game. They explain that while procedurally generated land can create vast amounts of land quickly, a curated approach adds a more engaging and realistic experience for players. The team has hand-sculpted the land in [Solace](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/zone-1-solace), resulting in unique variations in terrain and vegetation. They plan to focus on adding life, such as animals and sounds, to make the land feel more alive. A new character artist has recently joined the team to accelerate the creation of animals. The land development is a significant accomplishment for the team and a key aspect of the game that they are heavily focusing on.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=900) In this section the speakers discuss their excitement about the upcoming Consensus conference, which is expected to attract over 14,000 attendees. They reflect on the progress of their project and the addition of new team members. The team is looking forward to attending the conference, and they plan to create content, interview other groups, and network with other projects. The speakers also mention the challenges of traveling and the possibility of developing an AI travel agency.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=1200) In this section Scruffy welcomes the audience and discusses the importance of having an attractive background for streaming. The conversation then shifts to the topic of backgrounds and the tools they can use to enhance them, such as custom vehicles and security bots. The team then talks about their roles, with Scruffy focusing on marketing and QA. They discuss their recent work on Solace, and how they've been refining their processes to make it more efficient and quicker to develop new versions. They also mention working on bugs and other small issues in the game. Overall, the team is working on improving their processes and creating a better user experience.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=1500) In this section Scruffy expresses amazement at the level of detail and planning put into the game's land distribution system. Despite the vast size of the game, the team has already tested and refined a significant portion of it, with a focus on Solace 2 and upcoming Solace 3. Scruffy emphasizes the game's attention to detail and level playing field, as everyone will have an equal chance to choose their land plot. The team is still working on improving tools for testing and exploration, but he is impressed with what he's seen so far and believes there will be something for everyone.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=1800) In this section Scruffy expresses his excitement about the upcoming release of land in the game, and shares his personal preference for choosing land based on resources rather than aesthetics. He also compares the visual differences between Solace One, Solace Two, and Solace Three, noting that they follow a similar style but have distinct differences. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about the size of the areas covered in the game.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=2100) In this section Scruffy discusses the progress made in addressing bugs and improving efficiency within the team. They aim for near-perfection but acknowledge that complete elimination of bugs is unattainable. The team is working on prioritizing critical bugs for implementation and addressing user feedback. They also clarify that they have no plans to leave the Cardano chain and may consider developing a kid-friendly racing game in the future, depending on their current project priorities.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7lt060Y9mk&t=2400) In this section the team discusses the capabilities of the leaderboard system, which will allow for competitions and tournaments across various games, including racing and fishing. They reveal that an upgraded version of racing is coming soon, and racing rewards will be given for finishes. The team also mentions an upcoming [Valkyrie F9-R](/blockchain/player-owned-assets/asset-flying-vehicles/valkyrie/valkyrie-f9-r) sale, but the exact date is not yet announced. They express excitement about the potential for various types of games and seasonal events on the platform. The team thanks the audience for listening and signs off.
