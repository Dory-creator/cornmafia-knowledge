Fish
====

Fish are passive beings found in oceans and rivers. They are caught by fishing and can be cooked as part of a meal.

The life cycle begins with catching fish from rivers and oceans using a fishing rod. The fish is then taken to a kitchen to be prepared and cooked.

Ocean Fish
----------

Found along the coastlines of themed zones. Players must venture out on boats into deep water to capture them. 

River Fish
----------

Found in the rivers of the themed zones. Players must spot the fish and stand on river banks to get their catch.
