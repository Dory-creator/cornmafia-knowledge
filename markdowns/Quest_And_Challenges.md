Quest and challenges
====================

Quests and challenges are tasks the player can perform in Cornucopias. Upon completion players may receive rewards. Active quests are stored on a player's [hologram interface](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/user-interface).

### **Quests**

As the player ventures to the [Themed Zones](/gameplay/themed-zones) in Cornucopias, they will gather quests**.** They are obtained by speaking to NPCs or stumbling upon new locations. They provide activities and rewards. 

### **Daily challenges**

Every [district](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts) will have a [town hall,](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts/district-town-hall) which is a location to gather daily challenges, but it‚Äôs only accessible to village members. These challenges may include a list of [resources](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/resources) to gather, crops to farm, mini-games to play and points of interest to visit. If the player achieves all of them in a single ‚Äúgame day‚Äù then they will unlock their [Play-and-Earn](/gameplay/about-the-game/play-and-earn) rewards.
