Inventory
=========

The player inventory is a tool to hold items such as [Equipment](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/equipment) and [Resources](/gameplay/gameplay-pc/resources). 

The inventory system requires players to efficiently distribute their load to maximize their carrying ability. Items and equipment are initially stored in the players personal inventory space, which can be upgraded with backpacks. 

Players can then transfer items to their [Mount](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport) or [Flying Vehicle](/gameplay/themed-zones/transport/flying-vehicles) which has an increased carrying capacity. These items can also be transferred to the Sector Hub. A player must be in close proximity to their transfer location to complete the item transfer.
