> **Planning, Building, Prepping and Running the Holiday Season Mint**

December was an exciting month as we had our Holiday Mint.

Our NFT Marketplace got a HUGE update and is now able to accept [$COPI](/blockchain/cornucopias-token-usdcopi) as well as ADA for NFT mints.

A **huge update** to the COPIWiki was done to add more gameplay information about the [Land Plots](/gameplay/themed-zones/sectors/land-sector-districts/district-land-plots). 

We also had lots of discussion on how much we should release the Origin Story and in what format text/image/video - the next few months will show the outcome of those talks.

At the start of December we achieved the 63m ₳ staked milestone in the COPI StakePool from over 4,900 delegates.

### AOB

We have created a new internal Mental Health / Wellbeing initiative and we this has been received favorably.

With the announcement of the Holiday Mint, the social media and discord channels are growing fast. We achieved the 10k subscribers on the [Cornucopias YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CornucopiasGame).

We also achieved the [1,000 blocks](https://pool.pm/dda4bc64e339336e3f7bc158177df0c71dc760ff11cb8b0651b3ece4) produced milestone for the COPI Stakepool - wow - thankyou for your continued support!

We have opened new language channels on our Discord channel. We now have chats in English, Filipino, French, Thai and Slovenian.

As COPI Stakepool gets near to saturation, if you are looking for an alternative Stakepool, we also recommend the [Grow You Stake](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/grow-your-stake) Stakepool ticker: [GYS](/the-company/partners/partners-blockchain/grow-your-stake)

We are working on a roadmap for early 2023.
