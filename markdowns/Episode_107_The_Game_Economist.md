Episode 107 - The Game Economist
================================

In Episode 107 of [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) the Rob and Josh discuss the upcoming sale in Cornucopias. 

The sale includes new assets, some of which are rare and others free, like the Quantum Jack helmet. 

The speakers also discuss the game's features, such as jetpacks, nodes, and marketing strategies. 

They welcome a guest, Philip, who has contributed to their tokenomics and in-game economy. 

The conversation also includes answering viewer questions and discussing the game's infrastructure and player experiences. 

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=0) In this section Rob and Josh discuss the upcoming sale that includes over 17 new assets, some of which are variable rarity, fixed rarity and another that is free. These assets, which include male and female versions, will be usable in-game after the next game release. One of the free items in the sale is the Quantum Jack helmet, which is impressive with helmet animations. The team is working hard to prepare for the sale.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=300) In this section the speaker discusses various in-game items and features, including jetpacks and nodes. The jetpacks allow players to explore the game world more efficiently and discover new land. The speaker shares his excitement about testing the jetpacks. Next, the topic shifts to nodes, which allow node holders to use their compute power to serve up game files and reduce download times for new users. The speaker mentions that testing is ongoing, and the plan is to have the node feature fully rolled out by the end of the year. Daily rewards for node operators will also be claimable soon, with final testing underway for reward claiming.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=600) In this section the speaker discusses the shift in marketing strategy. He explains that the team has been focusing on owned media, such as their website and socials, but now aims to add large community partnerships and scale their influencer program. The speaker mentions a recent partnership that has been solidified. Additionally, they plan to introduce a buyback for certain assets in the sale, which is another chance to accept COPI in a sale. The speaker emphasizes that the time for marketing externally was not right when the product was not yet ready, but now that they have more content and seasonal content, it's the right time to make the mental shift and start marketing.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=900) In this section the speaker discusses the marketing efforts for upcoming games, specifically "Off the Grid," a web three game with a solid team and custom graphics. The game is well-funded and aims to change the perception of web 3 gaming by being one of the first legitimate projects in the market. The speaker has not yet played the game but follows its development closely. Off the Grid's marketing strategy includes collaborations with influencers like Ninja and TimtheTatman, who have been live streaming the game. The speaker believes that projects like Off the Grid are important for the web 3 gaming industry as they bring new attention to the sector from mainstream gamers, helping to change the perception of web 3 gaming.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=1200) In this section the speaker discusses the emerging trend of web3 games, which offer high-quality, AAA experiences and allow players to own and trade their in-game assets. This empowerment, he believes, will lead to the demise of web2 gaming within the next five years as major studios adopt player-owned assets to remain competitive. The speaker then introduces his guest, Phillip Black, a game Economist with an impressive background in the industry. Philip shares his journey into game economics, from studying economics at university to consulting and eventually being hired by Valve to study their Steam economy. He then moved on to work for Scopely in analytics, where he contributed to games like WWE Champions and Star Trek Fleet Command.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=1500) In this section Philip shares his career journey and insights about game economies. He mentions working on various game economies, some of which he significantly impacted, totaling around 30-40. He emphasizes that becoming a game economist isn't a common career path, and it's essential to think about what economics can offer to games rather than the other way around. He also discusses the importance of understanding the unique aspects of games and applying economic principles to enhance the gaming experience. Philip also touches upon the role of game economists in maintaining in-game economies and the importance of having a solid understanding of levers and progression to create a balanced and engaging gaming experience.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=1800) In this section Philip discusses the importance of creating a balanced game economy and the role of flowcharts in identifying relationships and understanding risk. He emphasizes the value of having a clear map of the economy's inputs, outputs, and currencies, and the importance of understanding the connections between them. Philip also shares his experience working on tokenomics and utility for a project, highlighting the benefits of having design space to distribute and regulate control through tokens. He also mentions the distinction between closed and open economies in web 3 and the importance of understanding the risks associated with floating prices and the impact on progression rates. The biggest mistake Philip has seen in the industry regarding tokens is designing for them to implode rather than understanding their value as an instrument in web 3.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=2100) In this section Philip discusses the importance and utility of tokens in gaming environments. He explains that tokens are not just a cool addition but serve as a claim on future goods or services in the game. Furthermore, they can also grant holders a standing in democratic councils that decide on major game features. The speaker also touches upon the potential lessons web 2 can learn from web 3, specifically in the context of game economies. He shares his experience of working with web 3 companies and the unique opportunities they present, particularly in the realm of markets and MMOs. The speaker highlights the importance of understanding the use cases of web 3 and the challenges it presents, and the potential for creating different loops and marketplaces within MMOs. Overall, the speaker emphasizes the significance of web 3 in gaming and the potential for innovative game experiences it can offer.
* [**00:40:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=2400) In this section Philip shares his experiences working at Amazon Game Studios, particularly with IP development and distribution. He emphasize the importance of having a clear vision for a game and how IP can help in reaching a larger audience. The speaker also discusses their excitement for Cornucopias, highlighting its unique features such as style, cars, and ships. He expresses his eagerness to work on the project and shares insights from his extensive experience in the gaming industry.
* [**00:45:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=2700) In this section the speakers express their excitement for various aspects of the upcoming game, including farming, mining, fishing, and custom domes. The farming element allows players to engage in honest work and progress through tasks, while mining offers a sense of community and exploration. Fishing, described as the largest possible fishing game in the world, is another anticipated feature, with the potential for realistic and fun experiences. Custom domes, which will be created and built by the community, are also highly anticipated, as they will provide unique PVP gaming spaces and potentially bring in new players. The speakers also look forward to the community aspect of the game, which will allow for large-scale dungeon raiding and combat elements. Despite the challenges of development, the speakers remain enthusiastic about the project.
* [**00:50:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=3000) In this section the conversation shifts to answering viewer questions.
* [01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_xZqwoj87s&t=3600) In this section the speakers delve into the cultural significance of Halloween, a seasonal celebration. People either engage in the traditional trick-or-treating practice or attend adult costume parties. The speakers also share hints about upcoming features in their game, including jetpacks that will enable players to explore expansive areas. The episode concludes with a teaser of upcoming content and a sign-off for the week.
