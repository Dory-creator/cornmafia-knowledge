Episode 102 - Enter the Multiverse
==================================

In Episode 102 of [COPICafe](/gameplay/community/copicafe) "Enter the Multiverse", Rob and Josh, the two Co-CEOs of Cornucopias, discuss their open world game.

The video showcases the public transport system and the World Travel Loop, allowing players to get around the massive world using Cloud Gates. The team also announces upcoming gameplay videos, a node update, a comparison of Unreal Engine 5.0 and 5.3, and a tournament announcement. 

They share their drinks, with Rob having a banana milkshake and Josh having water. The video provides sneak peeks of various game aspects, including the Solace sector, hidden discoveries, and the work-in-progress general store. 

The team also discusses the game's size, expansion plans, and the upcoming release of the node infrastructure for the Cornucopia project. They plan to list the game on the Epic store and create premium outfits for sale. The primary goal is to showcase the game's lore and demonstrate what Cornucopias is on the Epic Games Store, with plans to utilize assets to get listed and eventually downloaded via the node system.

* [**00:00:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=0) In this section of the video, Rob and Josh, the two Co-CEOs of Cornucopias, introduce the open world game. They announce what they are about to talk and share their drinks.
* [**00:05:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=300) In this section the speaker discusses a video showing the World Travel System in the game, which includes massive realms called sectors, each with a hub made up of three giant worlds. They are currently in the sector Hub, which has apartments for players and advertisement boards showcasing different areas. The speakers showcase various images of Solace, including deer and caves, to give players a sense of the world they can explore.
* [**00:10:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=600) In this section the creator discusses various discoveries made in Solace 2, including hidden caves and waterfalls. The community has found several interesting locations, such as a hidden building that turns out to be an electronics factory that players can build on their land plots to create electronic equipment and sell or trade. The creator also mentions a community contest where players share their sunset images from the game, showcasing the game's beautiful world and variety. The video also includes a sneak peek of a work-in-progress general store that will be featured in Cornucopias, further adding to the game's immersive experience.
* [**00:15:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=900) In this section the creators discuss the size and expansion plans of the game world. Solace consists of three areas, each are 8 km by 8 km worlds, making Cornucopias massive in scale. The completed Cornucopias world, including all unique zones, will be even larger. The creators compare the size to Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto, noting that all three Solace worlds, along with the sector hub and Calido Valley are handcrafted. The node system integration with the launcher is underway, which will allow the game to utilize the new file nodes infrastructure for game downloads. The next phase involves creating documentation for testers and the public to download and install docker packages, preparing for community-hosted nodes in the upcoming test mode.
* [**00:20:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=1200) In this section the speaker discusses the upcoming release of the node infrastructure. The rewards system for node performance will be rolled out gradually, with the goal of having the entire system running smoothly and publicly by November. Users will be able to create public or private pools, and delegation will be possible. The node infrastructure is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. An algorithm will be implemented to ensure quality node provision and reward nodes based on uptime. The desired outcome is to provide new users with a good onboarding experience. The first version of reward claiming is currently being tested internally, with plans to roll it out in early October. Two-factor authentication may be added for security. The speaker also shares a comparison video showcasing the progress of the Cornucopias project from Unreal Engine 5.0 to 5.3, highlighting improvements in color saturation, details, and assets.
* [**00:25:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=1500) In this section the speaker discusses the development process of the game and the team's progress from a prototype to a Pre-Alpha game. They express how it took a long time to get to where they are, with the help of Unreal Engine and the addition of more detail and performances. The speaker then announces a competition with a 100,000 COPI prize, split over several weeks, where the community can enter and team members are not eligible to win. They also mention an Art Book, which is being split over three episodes, and show amongst other images, pictures of a log processing machine and mining in Solace.
* [**00:30:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=1800) In this section they showcase a map from Solace and explain how to zoom in and change the perspective. The world breaker, where players begin their game, is introduced, and it's mentioned that a game trailer is being worked on for marketing purposes. The team plans to list the game on the Epic Store to generate more momentum. They also discuss creating Premium Outfits for sale and reveal concept art of the World Gate shown on the planet Earth.
* [**00:35:00**](https://youtube.com/watch?v=prDdb7ZJNPs&t=2100) In this section the creators discuss some of the lore of Cornucopias and the existence of multiple versions of Earth in the Multiverse. Each Earth has at least one World Gate. The primary goal of an upcoming trailer is to showcase its lore and demonstrate what Cornucopias is on the Epic Games Store. Although the game is not yet available on the Epic Store, the team plans to utilize their trailer to get listed on the waiting list. Once listed, the game will be downloaded via the node system, and the infrastructure will be beefed up to accommodate more players. The team is excited about this upcoming milestone and looks forward to sharing more information in future episodes.
